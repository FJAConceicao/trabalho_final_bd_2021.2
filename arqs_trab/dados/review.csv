0;My Favorite White Wine;This a fantastic white wine for any occasion!;5.0;0;0
1;Yum!!;Tart, not sweet...very refreshing and delicious!;5.0;1;1
2;A New Favorite!;I was given this wine so it was a delightful surprise to find that it has a flavorful and delicious taste! A new favorite!!!!;5.0;2;2
3;Bold, Flavorful, Aromatic, Delicious;This is a phenomenal wine and my new favorite red.;5.0;3;2
4;Yum! Plus, Environmentally Friendly!;4 750ml bottles for the price of two With way less packaging YES PLEASE! I was nervous it was too good to be true and I wouldnt like the wine but its fantastic! I have to go a bit out of my way to get it (I live near a state line and it isnt sold in my state due to liquor laws) but its worth it.;5.0;4;3
5;Great Taste;I LOVE Becks NA. It tastes just like a regular ale. It smells like one too. It tastes great. Its the only NA that I drink. My friends love it too. It has a great head when you pour.;5.0;5;4
6;Simply Wonderful;This wine has a wonderful but strong aroma its a bit bitter has a bite to it but still goodit was worth it in the end;3.0;6;5
7;A Sweet Red.;I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a sweet red. Instead it gets poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Targets shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less.;2.0;7;5
8;;Delicious and very affordable;5.0;8;6
9;Charles & Charles Red Blend;This is a very smooth red with Aromas of cocoa, coffee, tobacco sweet black cherry. Bold but soft. I highly recommend this one.;5.0;9;7
10;This Wine Made My Party!;Based on positive reviews, I served all of the Fancy Pants varieties at a recent party. My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads. Served well chilled, our Sauvignon Blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics.;5.0;10;8
11;Nice Sparkling Wine Compared To Champagne;Nice fruity and sweet taking sparkling wine. Goes great in mimosa. You have to try it to see how you will like it. Even the guys would enjoy this at your wedding!;5.0;11;9
12;Great Nh Beer!;A rich amber Ale with a subtle but noticeable hop character. Great beer to pair with food!;5.0;12;10
13;Dry-Hopped Ipa!;This light bodied IPA is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright HP aroma, balanced by a refreshing and crisp Ale. Great for a cookout out day at the beach, love it!;5.0;12;11
14;Dry-hopped Ipa!;This light bodied IPA is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright HP aroma, balanced by a refreshing and crisp Ale. Great for a cookout out day at the beach, love it!;5.0;12;11
15;Lovely! Try It!;Great for a perfect summer day or a get together with the girls.;5.0;15;12
16;Fizzy Pinot Grigio?;Im not sure if this is a bad bottle or if it was intentionally made effervescent. I dont want bubbles when I drink Pinot Grigio. Goes well with mozzarella string cheese and Cinemasins.;2.0;16;13
17;Obsessed;Obsessed with this new drink----However, it has been sold out at every Target I have been to lately :(;5.0;17;14
18;Great Wine;This is an excellent red wine, not to dry and not real sweet. More of a red blend. Great go with anything anytime. In the right price point as other known brands on the market.;5.0;18;15
19;Excellent Cab......!!!!!!!;One of the best Cabernets I had in quite sometime......!!!!!!;5.0;19;16
20;Highly Recommended;This is a great buy for the price. Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didnt want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. Its a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.;5.0;20;17
21;Michelob Ultra Light Cider;Gluten free plus lower on calories plus very refreshing!;5.0;21;18
22;Please Dont Discontinue This Flavor Combination!;Best of the bunch of all of The wine Cube skus. Target Wine Buyer: please bring back!;5.0;22;19
23;Wine Is Good - The Cube Is Not;I like the wine and I like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time. But when they re-sized the box a few months ago, it made it impossible to open and setup properly. While I applaud Target for reducing the packaging, this just isnt working.;3.0;23;20
24;Could Not Believe The Taste;I have tried my share of Moscato D Astis before, this has to be the smoothest that I have ever tried. Not too sweet or too fizzy but perfect. I got it for the pretty bottle but was very surprised about the taste. Try it, you wont be disappointed.;5.0;24;21
25;My New Fave!;Highly, highly recommend!! Its sweet but not syrupy- just right! And I love that its bubbly, I dont have to mix my wine with seltzer anymore!;5.0;25;22
26;;My favorite bottle design. The best cheap lager.;5.0;26;23
27;;Delicious. I hate all the other flavors but this one tastes great. Now if I can only find it in the store.;5.0;27;24
28;Who Can Say No To Awesome $5 Wine;This wine is amazing! Im an avid wine drinker (mom life) and Ill continue to buy this for sure. For 5 its a steal! Keep this around please, its just another reason to love target!;5.0;28;25
29;Good Wine For Beginners...;Love it that its not too dry or overly sweet. Also has a good balance of alcohol.;5.0;;26
30;Fantastic Wine;This wine was sooooo good. I usually dont like Cabernet but this special fermented wine is very tasty. It did not stay around too long.LOL.;5.0;30;27
31;The Cube Riesling;Some of the best boxed wine I have ever tasted. Great taste and great value.;5.0;31;28
32;Perfect For Summer;Love this Moscato and will be purchasing more on my next Target run. Let it chill in the fridge and enjoy on a hot summer day.;5.0;32;29
33;We Loved It!;Had my sissies (sistafriends) over for dinner/planning meeting....and theyre still talking about the loving fellowship and the great wine! I hope the store has more than 1 bottle left on its shelves!!!;4.0;33;30
34;Yum!;Great fruity dry rose!;5.0;34;31
35;An Outstanding Table Wine;Is this the greatest wine in the world, of course not. It is an eminently drinkable wine,as a matter of fact it is my preferred, and go to, table wine. Wine is a personal thing but for me it is my 1 pick in the under 10 category. It is well balanced, subtle, and very easy to sip. Dry without being overpowering. It is not a big bad Cabernet but it is not that in a good way. Goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise. I always have a bottle on my shelf.;5.0;35;32
36;New Go To White;Delicious white wine! Light, crisp, not too sweet. Almost too good.;5.0;36;33
37;No No No No No.... No;Just bad wine. The worst I have ever had. Try Bota Box Sarah is you are looking for a decent boxed wine.;1.0;37;34
38;Love This Love Noir;I am no wine expert by any means, but I love a good red for dinner or a cold night. This is the ticket. Rich, dark, fruity! Just lovely. The hubby liked it too!;5.0;38;35
39;Best Wine I Ever Tasted;Best wine I ever tasted;5.0;39;36
40;Excellent Chardonnay;not fruity, very satisfying. my go to chardonnay! excellent product - would expect to pay 10 / bottle for this quality;5.0;40;37
41;Vintners Red Boxed Wine;Picked some up on a trip to the beach as they are portable non breakable and priced right! I didnt know what to expect, honestly, my expectations were not too high, being boxed wine and all. I was pleasantly surprised! It is very drinkable delicious! When I got home I returned to Target to get the large wine cube box for at home enjoyment!;5.0;41;38
42;Great Sauvignon Blanc Even Compared To Medium-Priced Bottles;By far the best boxed wine Ive found, and comparable to medium-priced bottled sauvignon blancs. A great buy.;5.0;42;39
43;Great Sauvignon Blanc Even Compared To Medium-priced Bottles;By far the best boxed wine Ive found, and comparable to medium-priced bottled sauvignon blancs. A great buy.;5.0;42;39
44;;Taste was absolutely fine for a 5 Chardonnay. However, BOTH bottles broke while removing the corkscrew. Second break was far enough I didnt want to risk drinking it because of risk of glass shards. Ive bought cheaper wines like yellowtail, etc, and NEVER experienced a bottle breaking.;2.0;44;40
45;Great Wine For The Price.;I didnt find this to be sweet at all, but everyones taste differs. I usually dont like sweet wines so I gravitate towards Chardonnay and some Sauvignon Blancs and I felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated. For the price, this is definitely a keeper.;4.0;45;40
46;Love It!;My boyfriend brought this home on a whim. We were delighted at how tasty it was. Lasted us a couple weeks - even better!;5.0;46;41
47;Delicious!;I love Disaronno. It has a smooth texture and the flavor is lightly sweet. Its decadent on the rocks or with a little cream.;4.0;47;42
48;Great For The Price;Im surprised how good this is for the price! Tastes more like Sauvignon blanc to me...;5.0;48;43
49;;Nice, light wine - I was not sure what to expect but was surprised how well it tasted for a 5 bottle.;5.0;49;44
50;Pretty Good For Wine In A Box!;For as much as we drink white wine, I needed to find a budget bottle. Wed been doing 6-7 dollar bottles, but this beats that. And its pretty good! You wont impress anyone with this, but for a Monday-Thursday, home and on a budget drinking, this is good.;4.0;50;45
51;This Wine Made My Party!;I served this and all the different varieties at a party. My guests and I loved them all. Since I am not a wine expert, I will simply give you some of the notes on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...a robust and rich palate with ripe berries, red fruit, and toasty oak flavors. Cherries and vanilla spice on the mouth lead to a long, lingering finish.;5.0;10;46
52;Tried The Past Type & Its My Favorite So This Should Be Great!;I tried Beringer, who makes this, Pink Moscato, had no trouble opening it up with a Corkscrew, one which I just bought from Target in-store, really like its sweet, fruity flavor pink looking wine. I plan to stock up for the Holidays.;5.0;52;47
53;A Scrumptious Red!;If you like a fruit forward blend of reds with a very smooth finish and jammy taste, you will love this! I think my 9 year search for my favorite red wine has ended!;5.0;53;48
54;Refreshing Rose!;This is a dry Rose, not sweet at all which is perfect for summer!;5.0;54;49
55;Favorite Rosé;A wonderful dry wine, and the taste is just divine!;5.0;55;50
56;Favorite Ros��;A wonderful dry wine, and the taste is just divine!;5.0;55;50
57;Now Thats Cider;Been looking for Strongbow in the US for years;5.0;57;51
58;Refreshing;Refreshing, nice grapefruit flavor. Not for people that dislike seltzer water. Its good out of the can or poured over ice.;5.0;58;52
59;Here Are The Reasons I Like Truly;IT IS NOT SWEET,AND I LIKE THAT. IF YOU LIKE THE TASTE OF SPARKLING WATER WITH THE BENEFIT OF 5 ALCOHOL. THIS IS FOR YOU.;5.0;59;53
60;Best Cabernet Ive Ever Tasted, Simple As That.;Best Cabernet Ive ever tasted, simple as that.;5.0;60;54
61;I Love It!;so refreshing! LOVEIT!;5.0;61;55
62;Deliciously Tangy;This Cayman Jack margarita is really good. I found it in a Southern California Target, but I cant find it in Northern California stores. :(;5.0;62;56
63;Decent Beer For A Good Price;I expected this beer to be on the bitter side the first time I tried it, but I still enjoyed its smooth taste. Id definitely buy it if I get a chance.;4.0;63;57
64;Looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on ...;Looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on it so I ordered this puppy to put it to the test. definitely a switcher and fairly quiet. Well regulated Just like all of RM Italy products, great quality.;5.0;64;58
65;Luv This Wine;I love sparkling wine, but I find that most brands are sweet. Im aging and no longer want the sweet stufd. This is medium body wine with strong bubbles (I love bubbles ) . The alcohol content offers a nice buzz fairly quickly. So ecstatic I found this brand and Target carries it.;5.0;65;59
66;;I served this at my baby shower and everyone went crazy over it. Its an inexpensive gem.;5.0;66;60
67;delicious;This wine is full-bodied and delicious.;5.0;67;61
68;Great wine for price;Super wine with fruity taste. As a regular wine drinker this is our routine wine of choice. Priced right with good taste.;4.0;68;62
69;Not worth the money!;Had a taste of either being old or spoiled. Stick with the bottle.;1.0;69;62
70;Nice Red;This is our go-to wine for dinner parties. Better than most of the 10 bottles.;5.0;70;62
71;Always Have Jb Original On Hand;I have been enjoying Jim Beam Original for many years. I started mixing JB-O with Slice while wife and I watched Dallas. I have tried other whiskeys, but keep coming back to JB. Now I enjoy it mixed with Diet Pepsi (since I can no longer find Slice).;5.0;71;63
72;Yumm;It goes great in apple cider;5.0;72;63
73;Always Consistent;Consistent flavor and quality. JB with Dr. Pepper is surprisingly tasty. I highly recommend it. Love your commercials, too. Mila is doing you proud. Keep up the good work.;5.0;73;63
74;"A Drink That Stands Out; And Smooth As Well...";A true classic of spirits...;5.0;74;63
75;Perfect & Versatile;I love this Bourbon as it is always my first choice when its time to unwind. Whether its Neat, On Rocks, With a Coke or Ginger Ale, or my Grandpas Whiskey Sour, nothing tops Jim Beam!!!! Nothing!!!;5.0;75;63
76;It is the first drink I check everytime;The white label or the devils cut dashed with some lemonade and lime cordial is how I enjoy my Jim.;5.0;76;63
77;Yes I would buy again;Best Drink you can get;5.0;77;63
78;very reasonally priced;to make manhattens;4.0;78;63
79;One fine bourbon;Best bourbon I have found...have toured distillery and love the brand..;5.0;79;63
80;Red Stag stands alone;Red Stag and Coke Zero is my go to drink. Only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it. Nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick !;5.0;80;63
81;Good taste;I like it with dr.peper to sip and relax;5.0;81;63
82;The only whiskey I drink;Better than the others;5.0;82;63
83;Priced right and great quality;Drank it for years and always smooth and tasty. Now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store.;5.0;83;63
84;Best bourbon on earth.;I keep Jim Beam on hand every day of the week.;5.0;84;63
85;A Bourbon Legend;I typically have this neat or with an ice cube. Its light amber appearance, sweet, woody, mossy nose, and its mild moss, white oak, mellow wintergreen mint, and dried, faintly-candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin-point distilling execution. Jim Beam Original has a gradual finish, with a ghost of chocolate powder, during the fade out. Highly recommended. RJT;5.0;85;63
86;I would buy this drink over and over.;Its does have a great toaste to it the only drink Ill drink.;5.0;86;63
87;Smooth;I had a neat 2 finger glass two weeks ago of JB Black label for the first time (Ive always drank Jack Daniels) and I loved it! No more Jack for me!;5.0;87;63
88;smoothy;Best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around I love it!;5.0;88;63
89;Always in my liquor cabinet;I always keep a bottle of Jim Bean in my liquor cabinet. Value for price is incredible and it mixes great.;5.0;89;63
90;Best price;This is our favorite mixed drink whiskey and sams has the best price on a handle. Well be buying this again;5.0;90;63
91;Great product;Best whiskey around and a price that cant be beat!!;5.0;91;63
92;Very Reasonally Priced;to make manhattens;4.0;92;63
93;One Fine Bourbon;Best bourbon I have found...have toured distillery and love the brand..;5.0;79;63
94;It Is A Good Wine;I drink Yellow Tail because you can not buy a perfect wine for the price of this one, I JUST LOVE IT!!!!!!;5.0;94;64
95;Love;I always buy this item at Walmart cause they always have it at a Great Price;5.0;95;65
96;Awesome Bourbon;As a Scotch drinker, tasting Basil Haydens for the first time changed my opinion of Bourbons. Now I enjoy both Scotch Bourbon with BH on the top of list for Bourbons!;5.0;96;66
97;Love Basil Haydens;Very tasty bourbon!;5.0;97;66
98;Flavorful With A Smooth Finish;Basil Hayden was my gateway to world of Burbon. Ever since I have held its flavor profile as the gold standard when trying others on the market bit I always find myself coming back to my first love.;5.0;98;66
99;Spirit Of Choice;Outstanding. Simply an outstanding beverage. Spicy and light with a comforting finish. A staple in my home bar rotation - I never let a bottle get near empty without backfilling it with a fresh one.;5.0;99;66
100;Cooks Champagne;I love the Cooks champagne however I cannot drink the brut. Would love Extra dry to become available at Sams in Mobile AL.;5.0;100;67
101;Very Drinkable;My favorite red wine has been Menage a Trois for a long time, and this SILK blend is even better than the regular blend. The price has remained affordable while the quality has remained consistently good for these red blends.;5.0;101;68
102;My Favourite Riesling;My mother turned me on to Barefoot Riesling a few years back and it had been a reflex to always choose it when given the option.;5.0;102;69
103;Love;Been trying to find a red wine with a smooth finish. This stuff is exactly what I was looking for.;5.0;103;70
104;Excellente;Perfect sipping tequila ... chilled and neat !;5.0;104;71
105;Excellente;Perfect sipping tequila ... chilled and neat !;5.0;105;71
106;Solid tequila;My buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game. Frankly when it comes to tequila, I usually brace myself for a rough shot. Maybe Im drinking the wrong stuff, because this was really easy to put back. No lingering aftertaste. Reasonably priced. Good value tequila if youre looking.;5.0;106;71
107;One of my favorite!;Straight over ice.;5.0;107;71
108;Amazing Drink;My drink of choice when I really want to enjoy my time alone.;5.0;108;72
109;Makes The Best Jello Shots Ever!!;Makes orange jello taste like creamsicle, strawberry taste like strawberries and cream, lemon taste like lemon meringue....I could go on and on....get some today!!;5.0;109;72
110;"""the Best Jerry, The Best""";Pinnacle has been making our Martinis in my family for many years. My late father discovered it years ago when someone said its on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter, but at a very reasonable price. Try it, bet youll love it too. Al;5.0;110;72
111;Pinnacle Whipped Bodka;The whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous. I keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when I want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap. Love it!;5.0;111;72
112;Love this product!;Everything is great about this product, cheap price, perfect taste. Mixing this flavor with just a soda makes it delicious.;5.0;112;72
113;I Love This Stuff !!!!;I love this vodka, I have been drinking vodka for many years, and this is by far one of the best, and my favorite vodka. I drink it regularly, usually with grape juice, but also with orange juice. We use it to make daiquiris, and many other frozen concoctions.;5.0;113;72
114;So So;Just so so. Seems to be missing something. There are much better margarita mixes out there without all the additives this does not have.;2.0;114;73
115;Smooth And Fruity.;Very good summer red. Its become our favorite reasonably priced wine that we enjoy on its own.;4.0;115;74
116;seagrams escapes;love all of the flavors. will be buying again. great for summer drinks;5.0;116;75
117;Variety Value;I bought this pack on a whim and Im so glad I did. There is a variety of drinks for a great price, even less than the discount liquor store! Ill definitely get this again!;4.0;117;75
118;Line;Vrty good;5.0;118;75
119;Enjoy there flavors;Jamaican me happy;4.0;119;75
120;Tasty if you can find it;Really enjoy these but SAMs likes to send you on wild goose chases saying available and none to be found not even the empty pallet;5.0;120;75
121;Best Red Blend for the price;We have been buying Apothic Dark for a couple of years now. It is our Red Blend of Choice. Very Smooth and very reasonably priced.;5.0;121;76
122;pretty good;Decent table wine for the price. Bend that is on the sweeter side of the spectrum.;3.0;122;76
123;Very popular;Rum Chata is great when mixed with Fireball or Caramel Vodka;5.0;123;77
124;Love The Cucumber Chili, Wish It Wasnt Discontinued.;Love this brand of tequila. Im a Margarita fan and like to make different kinds;5.0;124;78
125;Beer;love it wouldnt mind drinking more;5.0;125;79
126;Good, Cheap, Summer Lake Beer;On a hot day near the water, this is the cheap-ish beer to have. Bud light with a solid splash of lime, makes it a light and refreshing choice. The Target 12-pack is average-priced and will provide a beverage most will enjoy - particularly the ladies.;4.0;126;80
127;This Is Great!;Love this vodka - its perfect for screwdrivers! It blends so well with the juice and for an interesting citrus blend, you can use grapefruit juice.;5.0;127;81
128;One of our favorites;Weve been drinking this wine for a while. Its one of a group we buy regularly because its a good wine at an affordable price.;5.0;128;82
129;Like an old friend;Never disappointed, constant taste.;4.0;129;82
130;A hidden gem;A delicious blended wine ... give it a try, you might be surprised;5.0;130;82
131;Best Reisling!;This is by far the best reisling Ive ever had! LOVE it! Always consistent in flavor and my go to!;5.0;131;83
132;Delicious;Great Taste dont forget a slice of orage on the side!;5.0;132;84
133;Yum!;Very fruity. Smooth. I like it straight over ice with a bit of Chambord.;5.0;133;85
134;Bitter Acrid Terrible Tea;Tastes absolutley nothing like Chinese restaurant tea... not even similar. Its absolutley horrible, bitter and acrid. With shipping I paid 50 cents per bag... what an amazing rip off. You can go to a local Oriental store and get this kind of stuff for 2 cents per bag... and it would probably taste better.;;134;86
135;Very good tea.....;I dont know why some people wrote bad reviews about this tea. It is just like the tea Ive grown up with that I had in Chinese Restaurants. The only complaint I have is that I found the same tea while visiting an Asian store out of town and it was only 2.00 per box while this one was more than double plus a 2.99 shipping fee. I knocked the rating down one star because of the outrageous price this seller charges.;;135;86
136;Loving It;Had a cup of this tea and it was like reliving the past. Always drank this blend at a small Chinese Resturant in Queens, NY. After my first sip I felt like I was back thier enjoying a big pot of tea. Smooth and Relaxing, great blend and will be ordering more soon.;;136;86
137;Great tea!!;Yes! this IS just like the Chinese restaurant tea. I used to receive a tea bag or two from my favorite Chinese take out, but nobody does that anymore. Id save my teabag for the next day to drink with the leftovers, to enhance the leftovers. Now, I can enjoy this tea anytime. This is a refreshing tea that does not make one feel as if we should be adding milk and/or eating some cookies or cakes with it. This tea can stand alone and refresh the inner soul. I drink it with just a pinch of sugar.;;137;86
138;Fantastic Tea;I gave this to my husband for christmas and he loves it. Says it smells good, it has a nice flavor and a smooth texture, just like the tea you are served in Chinese Restaurants :);;138;86
139;Tasty blend of green, jasmine and oolong tea. Hard to find in stores where I live.;I really like this tea and have bought it many times. The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesnt contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people dont like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones dont even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions. (My store had carried it but stopped apparently due to this regional issue -- no longer available in our part of PA.) It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it! Thanks for carrying it, Amazon and friends!;;139;86
140;ILOVETHISTEA;Really, thats all I have to say. I have ordered this tea several times. Tastes EXACTLY like the Chinese tea that you can find in any major Chinese restaurant.;;140;86
141;Good taste, but is it real Ginseng;I really like the taste of the tea, especially cold. Its a green tea mixed with Ginseng, and theyve added licorice root to perhaps sweeten the tea. I dont even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, Im guessing its a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, its very tasty this way! You dont have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round.;;141;86
142;Good taste And Good tea;I like all ingredients in this tea: Green tea, Licorice root and Ginseng. Specially Licorice root can relieve a spasmodic cough and test like Mint;;142;86
143;Good stuff;We like this brand especially when we make stir fry. Cant find it in the grocery stores any longer and was happy I could find it on line.;;143;86
144;Great Taste And Great Value!;This is my favorite Riesling. When I spotted it on sale for 9.99 a bottle I was delighted. I usually pay around 12.99 at other locations. Buying two bottles saved me six dollars, Thanks Target.;5.0;144;87
145;Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat;Refreshing taste of beer especially for summer, citrus combined w/ blueberry.;5.0;145;88
146;Right On Target, Great After A Busy Day;Right on Target - Sierra Nevada Torpedo Ale has outstanding character, warm, subtle hints of fruit and a strong but not overly bitter hop aftertaste. It is excellent after a hard days work to kick back and relax. Target recently began carrying beer and I could not be more enthused! ...;5.0;146;89
147;Excellent IPA;Best beer for the money. Wish the club in Omaha would carry it again. Any idea if any club carries it;5.0;147;89

150;Always Have Jb Original On Hand;I have been enjoying Jim Beam Original for many years. I started mixing JB-O with Slice while wife and I watched Dallas. I have tried other whiskeys, but keep coming back to JB. Now I enjoy it mixed with Diet Pepsi (since I can no longer find Slice).;5.0;71;92
151;"""awesome""";My momma LOVES this stuff....!! Its the taste that will rockur socks off!!;5.0;151;92

161;Priced right and great quality;Drank it for years and always smooth and tasty. Now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store.;5.0;83;92
162;Best bourbon on earth.;I keep Jim Beam on hand every day of the week.;5.0;84;92
163;A Bourbon Legend;I typically have this neat or with an ice cube. Its light amber appearance, sweet, woody, mossy nose, and its mild moss, white oak, mellow wintergreen mint, and dried, faintly-candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin-point distilling execution. Jim Beam Original has a gradual finish, with a ghost of chocolate powder, during the fade out. Highly recommended. RJT;5.0;85;92
164;I would buy this drink over and over.;Its does have a great toaste to it the only drink Ill drink.;5.0;86;92
165;Smooth;I had a neat 2 finger glass two weeks ago of JB Black label for the first time (Ive always drank Jack Daniels) and I loved it! No more Jack for me!;5.0;87;92

176;Black Cherry Tasty;TASTE DRINK;5.0;176;95
177;.tastiest Of Tasties.;This is by far the best flavored vodka on the market. I drink it with soda water the flavor is crisp. Not sweet or thick at all.;5.0;177;95
178;I wouldnt buy it again;Its really smooth but the taste isnt so good. More on the cough syrup side than black cherry and vanilla. It was a waste of money. The green apple and blood orange are the best ones .;1.0;178;95

182;Nice, Fresh, Tasty With Character;Starborough was a surprise as an alternate to Fume Blanc or Grigio wines. This is a soft and above average tasty white wine. Citrus Aroma, gracious acidity, layered texture is enough to satisfy Chardonnay as an alternate crisp finish and a nice experience.;4.0;182;97
183;The Best Tasting Burbon Ive Come To Love The Most!!;No matter how many different whiskeys there is, not a one, so far, has been able to resist my taste for the LOVE 0f JIM BEAM!!;5.0;151;98
184;Yes, Yes;your product is the smoothest going down, and make great gifts;5.0;184;98
185;I Love All Jim Beam Products, Really Enjoy The Smoothness.;I use Jim Beam to make alot of different kinds of marinades and sauces. I make a honey bourbon marinade for smoking jerky that tastes amazing. Everyone says its the best jerky theyve ever had. Thanks for making the best bourbon on the market Jim Beam!;5.0;185;98
186;Smooth;Wife and I enjoy it mixed with a Coke or a Monster Black Cherry. Excellent.;5.0;23;98
187;I Love This Stuff;This is my favorite bourbon. I even love its aroma. It has that nice vanilla scent going on. I never get tired of Jim Beam Black.;5.0;187;98
188;Magnificent oak flavor!;Im a single malt Scotch guy. I generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week. On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor. It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price. Youve got a customer for life!;5.0;188;98
189;My favorite bourbon!;Exceptionally good flavor!;5.0;189;98
190;Top Choice Every Time!;No matter where I go after years of various bourbon tastings....Jim Beam Black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag!;5.0;190;98

194;I love Jim Bean;I first started drinking Jim Bean when i went camping. I didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean. My first was Red Stag Cherry. Than i tried devils cut when i came home. I have been hooked ever since. I usually mix with coke or dr.pepper.;5.0;194;98
195;Best bourbon under 50;This is the best bourbon under 50 you can buy. One of the smoothest bourbons Ive tasted. I typically drink Woodford Reserve or Eagle Rare until I tried this. I buy a bottle every two weeks now.;5.0;195;98
196;I would definitely buy this quality bourbon again;This is Beam at its best very smooth.;5.0;196;98
197;Just the best!!;I tried JB Black for the first time tonight. It is so smooth. We made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome. Thanks Jim Beam for this awesome bourbon!!!;5.0;197;98
198;Love it, cannot find it anywhere;I have been enjoying JB Black for the past three years. The has all the flavor os a higher proof, bur 86, I can have another without collapsing. Now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area. What happened The double oaked is OK, but no match for the black. Where can I find it in Sonoma County, California;5.0;198;98

203;Beautiful cabernet!;One of the best on the shelf for under 20.;5.0;203;99
204;Actually Quite Tasty;I purchased this item to make Mimosas and had some left over. The mimosas were delicious. I found the California Champaign tasteless when too cold and just right at a lesser temperature. Of course it is not Dom Perignon but who would make Mimosas with Dom, anyway;5.0;204;100
205;Amazing Drink;My drink of choice when I really want to enjoy my time alone.;5.0;108;101
206;"""the Best Jerry, The Best""";Pinnacle has been making our Martinis in my family for many years. My late father discovered it years ago when someone said its on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter, but at a very reasonable price. Try it, bet youll love it too. Al;5.0;110;101
207;Pinnacle Whipped Bodka;The whipped creme flavored vodka is fabulous. I keep it in the freezer and have a snifter of it when I want something smooth after dinner or as a night cap. Love it!;5.0;111;101
208;I Love This Stuff !!!!;I love this vodka, I have been drinking vodka for many years, and this is by far one of the best, and my favorite vodka. I drink it regularly, usually with grape juice, but also with orange juice. We use it to make daiquiris, and many other frozen concoctions.;5.0;113;101
209;Theres only one way to rock!;Great run to mix up the rocking fun! Get some today and mix away.! You wont be disappointed.;5.0;209;102
210;Love;Love it. Great tast!;5.0;210;103
211;Not as tasty as other Sangrias;If Im going to buy a Sangria, this is not the one Id choose. The flavor was not as fruity as others Ive had and was not pleasant for my palate.;2.0;211;104
212;On of our favorites!;We are not big wine drinkers but we love this stuff. It is just sweet enough and not as bitter as regular wine and you can really taste the fruity undertones. The price is nice as well. Recommended.;5.0;212;104
213;The Only Sangria For Me;The is absolutely the best Sangria ever. Hoping Sams continues to carry it. I buy six bottles each visit.;5.0;213;104
214;Very Yummy;I have searched high as low for this sangria and it is by far the best tasting. It is not too sweet, and very smooth. I love it chilled because its perfect for a hot summers day.;5.0;214;104
215;Finest Sangria for the price;I purchase this every time I go to Sams. Then is started to disappear! This last time we went, there was a mini case of six...bought them all, scared that something this good might not re-appear. Please reassure us that you will continue to carry it!;5.0;215;104
216;Very Mild wine;No after taste love this wine.;5.0;216;104
217;Delicious;Have you ever just wanted a wine that gives you that fruity juicy taste without the hard alcohol kick well this is it still gives you that cocktail buzz without that hard taste, love this stuff even my very picky grandmother loves it!!!!;5.0;217;104
218;Great deal;What a delightful surprise. Excellent taste and aroma. Nice after finish.;5.0;218;105
219;Worse wine Ive ever had;I love Cabernet and Merlot wines. I couldnt even finish a glass of this stuff...and thats saying a lot.;1.0;219;106
220;Great every day wine;We have been drinking this wine for 10+ years. Its just a good every day table wine that will not break the bank.;5.0;220;106
221;Love this wine for everyday table wine.;Im a wine girl from way back. Had a lot of pricey wines, some I liked, some I poured down the drain. Same with cheaper wine.Usually I stay right in the middle to be happiest. However, a close friend recommended this one to me a couple of years ago as a nice, everyday wine, and I have to say that for those purposes, this is one of my favorites.;4.0;221;106
222;Absolutely undrinkable!;Its not often that you come across a wine this bad. Ive tasted cooking wines that were better. Unfortunately, my wife bought four bottles of this stuff. Tried to return it, but Sams wouldnt accept it (not that I blame them). Id pour it down the sink, but it might damage the pipes. Sigh...;1.0;222;106
223;Bottle are better;I am not happy they only carry cans. The bottles are much better bring them back please!!!!!!;1.0;223;107
224;Real Good Crisp Taste;Yummmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy;5.0;224;108
225;Delicious Beer;This beer is delicious. But I have to tell you that it is quite sweet, so if you dont like cream soda, you wont like it. In my case, it is perfect and I absolutely love it.;5.0;225;109
226;Fresh and cheap;It was very fresh and cheaper than anywhere in the area.;5.0;173;110

229;My red sauce favorite;Really enjoy, no strong tannin after taste. OK price. We pull out a bottle to have w/ pizza, red sauce dishes. Found this to be a smooth red w/ meals.;5.0;229;111
230;excellent;Everyone I share this with, loves it! Great tasting and soft, with no harsh aftertaste.;5.0;230;112
231;Good wine without a cork screw.;I bought two bottles of Meiomi and give one to a friend. I enjoyed drinking my bottle but was wondering if it can be aged.;4.0;231;112
232;Try It With Ice Cold Mtn Dew;I just bought a fifth of Jim Beam Apple and mixed it with ice cold Mtn Dew. It was great especially if you add a twist of fresh lemon;5.0;232;113
233;I Would Buy This Drink Again And Again If;We buy this bottle every week but the only thing we do not like is that every time you take the top off it leaves a black residue in the drink and a gross smell on your hand from twisting the top off ! If you guys could fix that then it would be twice more amazing;3.0;233;113
234;Great Product;I went to my local store to purchase another apple flavored product but saw this decided to purchase Jim Beam Apple instead. Im glad that I did. I mix my Jim Beam with cranberry juice and if I want it to be a little fizzy Ill add some Seagrams ginger ale. Love this drink and will be purchasing more soon.;5.0;234;113
235;Fantastic;I was hesitant to buy Jim Beam Apple, after trying other apple whiskeys, but I was not disappointed! Its so smooth, light and fruity. Very good!;5.0;235;113
236;Surprising And Refreshing;I mix the Jim Beam apple with a little ginger ale, it is a great summer refreshment.;5.0;236;113

247;My Favorite Wine;This is a fruity dessert wine. Since I had my first taste of a Gewurtztraminer wine I have bought wine from this grape from 12 different countries (and vineyards). This Fetzer Gewurtztraminer has the best flavor and body of all the ones Ive tried. Its hard to find, but worth trying, if youve never tried a wine from this grape before.;5.0;247;116
248;Hoppy! Best Hoppy Beer.;Best Beer on market. Mans Beer. Leaves Hoppy aftertaste. Approx. 248 Cals per 12 oz. Maintain exercise if drinking two or more per day...it will add weight.;5.0;248;117
249;Love This Brew!;Great refreshing taste! Not a weak beer. Safe ingredients that are non-gmo.;5.0;249;117
250;;Yuck. Im the type who usually rants and raves over Trump brands, but this wine is AWFUL. Was so shocked, I spilled it ALL OVER my favorite brown shirt. Sad!;1.0;250;118
251;Crest Floss Picks;These are hard to find. Vendor shipped fast and it was exactly what I ordered and for the price I agreed to. Will buy again;;251;119
252;the best floss picks;The other ones are too tight and hard to use. These have a good shape and grip and also are a bit looser so you can get the whole tooth.;;252;119
253;Crest Glide Floss Picks RULE;Im not sure why I cant find these in the grocery or drug stores any more, but I cant live without them. It is the only floss that does not get caught in my fillings. So easy to use that I actually enjoy flossing now. Highly recommend this product.;;253;119

260;"A Drink That Stands Out; And Smooth As Well...";A true classic of spirits...;5.0;74;122
261;Perfect & Versatile;I love this Bourbon as it is always my first choice when its time to unwind. Whether its Neat, On Rocks, With a Coke or Ginger Ale, or my Grandpas Whiskey Sour, nothing tops Jim Beam!!!! Nothing!!!;5.0;75;122
262;Very Reasonally Priced;to make manhattens;4.0;92;122
263;One Fine Bourbon;Best bourbon I have found...have toured distillery and love the brand..;5.0;79;122
264;Very good sweet;Very smooth sweet wine. Just wish wine companies would mark wine with dry, medium dry, sweet, extra sweet.;5.0;264;123
265;Decent Bitter Red Wine;I was told at a wine store that this wine is more of a mix of two different red wines. Other then the fact that it leaves a bit of red on my lips even after Ive finished drinking I loved it. If you enjoy bitter red wines this is pretty good. Ive tried many cheaper bitter red wines and the price point and quality of this so far has been great. Id definitely suggest giving this a try you just might like it.;4.0;265;124
266;Good wine...;...At a great price;4.0;266;125
267;Simply Refreshing;I been drinking Riunite for years......its great with food, partying with friends and family, or just relaxing. I will be buying it for the Holidays to go with my Gumbo..;5.0;267;126

270;Great wine;This wine is amazing its not too sweet not to bitter. It is a great inexpensive wine.;5.0;270;126
271;great cab cheap price;Fruity, full body, cheap. Go well with Asian foods! If you are looking to buy a red for wedding, this is the one. I got so many compliments from my anniversary this year on this red. If you want the cheaper wine, sure, you can go with VEO or Menage a Trois though. Carnivor is still a great wine!;4.0;271;127
272;Best wine for newbies;I bought this wine for my christmas party and everyone loved it, especially the guests whod never had wine before. Bartenura Moscato beat out all the other kinds that Id set out for the party.;5.0;272;128
273;Luccio Moscato D Asti;Had a chance to try some this beverage. Wonderful sparkling taste! Great for celebrations.;5.0;273;129

283;LOVE THIS SWEET RED;All the people I had referred this wine with were impressed as how smooth and tasty this wine is! However, this only has 7 alcohol. But thats about how far sweet reds go, if you can find sweet red this sweet that is over 10 alcohol content please let me know! I absolutely love this SWEET RED!;5.0;124;133
284;Definitely one of my favorite wines.;You can never go wrong with this wine, a glass of this Roscato and you are set. It is not sparkling, dry, or overbearing. Definitely my go to.;5.0;284;133
285;Roscato;This Roscato is sweet. Very crisp and mildly sweet, but it is delicious;5.0;285;133

287;AN AWESOME WINE;WHAT FULL LIGHT SWEET TASTEING TABLE WINE. ALSO VERY GOOD TO COOK WITH,GREAT FLAVOR.;5.0;287;133
288;Delicious!;This candy is amazing! Im a BIG tea fan. Iced, hot, green, black, whatever kinda tea it is, i like it. The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday. Overall, some of the greatest hard candy ive ever tried, and by far, the best tea candy.;;288;134
289;Delicious;This is a great candy, rich flavor, and everyone who tried it, loved it, I will be ordering this fine candy again.;;289;134
290;Great way to try all three flavors...;This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Balis Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real! Before doing that, I will buy a case of 12 packs from a vendor offering free shipping.;;290;134
291;Its okay;Nothing to get up about and I thought it was expensive. I took them to work for everyone, there still there! lol;;291;134
292;It is tasty.;This is tasty. I liked it. The only drawback is that the individual wrappers are not sealed well so once the main package is opened many of them will get sticky in a month or two. Nor much of a problem really.;;292;134
293;LATTE TEA CANDY;Had already tried liked the Citrus Green Tea Candy. Thought Id give this flavor a go - but muchly prefer the Citrus.;;293;134
294;Not a great flavor;Im a huge fan of BBs coffee candies and I adore green tea and matcha so I thought I would love these. They have a really odd taste after about 1 min in your mouth. I couldnt finish even one sadly and I was really looking forward to these.;;294;134
295;Unusual but good!;Tried the Green Tea Latte while in Aruba and loved them! Tried the three pack and Im hooked. I love the citrus best, but all are different and great throat lozenges (I hate menthol lozenges).;;295;134
296;Pretty Bottles;The bottles are very pretty we havent opened them yet. They look just like the picture pink with the emoji on them. Delivery was on time.;5.0;296;135
297;Fantastic!!!;I have tried the Margarita mix and the Bloody Mary mix. The Margarita mix is fantastic, especially if you add a little lime juice. The Bloody Mary mix is also very good but I like the Zing Zang Bloody Mary a little better and I think it is worth the few extra carbs. I plan to try the rest of the Scales Mixes and have already restocked the Margarita mix.;;297;136
298;Tasty mix !;I love this margarita mix! It has a great taste, and in my opinion it does not taste like fake sugar at all. My husband however was not a fan - he found it much too tart. I think its definitely worth a try!;;298;136
299;Delicious!;I loved everything about this stuff. Now, Im a local Charlestonian and can get this in my grocery store. But, if you are looking for a good healthy alternative to a Margarita, GO FOR IT! Their company website also offers this mix at a lower price. ENJOY!;;299;136
300;GREAT PRODUCT- TERRIBLE PRICE!;3 stars only because this really tasty No Calorie margarita mix cast me 17 FOR ONE BOTTLE!Im a margarita fan and also trying to lose some weight. There arent many really good lime mixers out there in the Low to NO Calorie category, so when I discovered SCALES on the shelf while visiting in Scottsdale AZ (for a reasonable 6.99 bottle), I was delighted to discover how tangy limey good it tastes- just right for excellent margaritas, but cutting about 100-150 calories out of your cocktail!I was dismayed when I returned home (though not exactly surprised) to find that Scales was not available in Washington state. So when I looked for it on Amazon and saw its other flavors offered on prime for 7.99 and the Margarita was offered at 17, I thought this must be for two or three bottles. When only one showed up... well, what the hell.Still a great mixer, but why cant we get it for a reasonable price!!;;42;136
301;0 Carb, 0 Sugar, 0 Satisfaction;To me this tastes like a Crystal Light lemonade or lemon-lime mix. For the price and the many highly positive reviews, I had really expected something much tastier. I added the juice of two limes but still didnt care for the flavor compared to regular (not sugar-free) but less expensive margarita mixes Ive tried. My spouse threw out his drink after one taste. We threw away the bottle so as not to waste any more tequila with this mix.;;301;136
302;Great taste... but pricey online...;For zero carbs/sugar this stuff is great. However the price online here is double that of my local grocery store. Unless I am missing something from the description that this is a multipack.If you are wanting a tasty zero carb drink this will certainly please you. The price here makes it tough to swallow.;;302;136
303;Tastes awful!;I am not sure why the other people said that this tastes good.... in my opinion it tastes awful! I would much rather not have a drink at all than drink this stuff.;;303;136
304;Root Beer Flavor;Wanted Watkins Products root beer extract but it seems it is no longer available. This brand is all right but do not like the caramel color additive. Watkins is clear;3.0;304;137

353;WOW;I bought this product because I was in a squeeze to make drinks for a backyard BBQ party. I saw it on the the shelf (only 1 left!) and thought, Mm mules sound good for a nice spring day. I had pretty low expectations given my experience with other pre mix products, but let me tell you, WOW this product is delicious. Its the perfect balance of sweet and spicy ginger and reminds me of sipping out of fancy frozen glasses with friends at one my FAVORITE outdoor cocktail bars. Next time Ill just invite them to my backyard! This mix has me excited to try some of the other flavors, but I cant imagine ever passing up on the mule when I see it on the shelf!! Thanks Vincent, whoever you are, for making me a mule pro );4.0;311;142
354;PERFECT for the home!;Great product. Fresh ingredients made a great mule. My friends dont have to know it was a mix );5.0;354;142
355;Just wow!;I had the pleasure of drinking a cocktail cooked up by Vince when dining at Philadelphias The Good King Tavern (which you must check out if youre in town, simply delicious!!).

366;Moscow Mule Delight!;I am hands down a vodka-drinker and LOVE a good Moscow Mule (especially in one of those icy cold copper mugs). My only complaint is that when I order them at bars, they are often way too sweet. This product tastes like fresh ginger and lime and the sugar is balanced perfectly! Great crowd pleaser when entertaining. People will think you made it from scratch!;5.0;366;142
367;BEST MULE EVER!!!!;I never thought mixes could be so good! I have been a cocktail enthusiast for sometime now but can never find the time to go out.

373;This stuff is amazing!;I love love love this mix. Im not usually a mix girl, as I usually feel like it ends up being too sugary / doesnt taste how its supposed to. But a friend recommended this to me and I tried it and its perfect! Especially for an amateur cocktail-maker... Its not too sweet which allows you to sweeten as wanted, and its fresh and delicious. And bonus, theres a pretty cute guy on the label. Highly highly recommend for Mule lovers!;5.0;373;142
374;Great and convenient mix!;Not only does it taste great and is refreshing on a hot summer day, but its now a breeze to mix up a mule! I love how quick I can make one that tastes good, for myself and others. Highly recommended.;5.0;374;142

445;Really good inexpensive tequila;I am a Cabo and Patron Anejo snob, who wouldnt drink Jose Quervo to save my own life. Jose Quervo is not tequila, but Solana Silver is! I wanted to try a silver, and picked this up on a gamble, at half the price of what I normally buy. 100 agava smooth tasted like tequila should!;5.0;445;146
446;Solana Tequila;Solana Blanco is a very mild tasting tequila. If you see it on a Walmart shelf, grab it and try it. You will not be disappointed. It flies off the shelf at my store.;5.0;446;146

449;Magnificent oak flavor!;Im a single malt Scotch guy. I generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week. On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor. It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price. Youve got a customer for life!;5.0;188;149
450;My favorite bourbon!;Exceptionally good flavor!;5.0;189;149

455;I love Jim Bean;I first started drinking Jim Bean when i went camping. I didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean. My first was Red Stag Cherry. Than i tried devils cut when i came home. I have been hooked ever since. I usually mix with coke or dr.pepper.;5.0;194;149
456;Best bourbon under 50;This is the best bourbon under 50 you can buy. One of the smoothest bourbons Ive tasted. I typically drink Woodford Reserve or Eagle Rare until I tried this. I buy a bottle every two weeks now.;5.0;195;149
457;I would definitely buy this quality bourbon again;This is Beam at its best very smooth.;5.0;196;149
458;Just the best!!;I tried JB Black for the first time tonight. It is so smooth. We made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome. Thanks Jim Beam for this awesome bourbon!!!;5.0;197;149
459;Love it, cannot find it anywhere;I have been enjoying JB Black for the past three years. The has all the flavor os a higher proof, bur 86, I can have another without collapsing. Now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area. What happened The double oaked is OK, but no match for the black. Where can I find it in Sonoma County, California;5.0;198;149

497;Clam Juice Is Weak;What has to happened Clamato Over the past few months I have noticed a distinct difference in the taste of Clamato original. There seems to be less clam juice taste and more tomato and sweet taste. Is it just me or has anyone else noticed I want more clam.;4.0;497;155
498;Question About Clamato;Hello I wanted to know if this drink has an expiration date because I dont see it . or how long can it last ecen when is not open and when it is;5.0;498;155

510;Cold with lemon;Had it as an appetizer 25 years ago and drank it ever since;5.0;510;155
511;Sodium content;I simply love Clamato - its simply delicious. However, the sodium content is so high that I do not drink it at all anymore. If a low sodium version was made it would be the only product of this nature I would purchase.;3.0;511;155
512;High Fructose corn syrup;this product as well as many others would be more appealing to me and others if the HFCS was replaced with cane sugar. You have a good product and there are ways to make it better. An increase in price would not deter me in the least. Look at the growth of the organic industry. Need I say more;2.0;512;155

522;Proudly flavored with Clams;Clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great Cocktail is seasoned with Clams (I wish there were more Clam Juice in it), as they never mention that part of the name sake. Be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with Clam Juice.....Put more in please!!;5.0;522;155
523;Great Stuff;I love this juice. It makes great red beers, bloody marys, red bulls, etc. Plus it is great just by itself.;5.0;523;155
524;Delicious bloody Caesars;I was shyed away at first from clamato. Strange enough, I love bloody Marys and all I eat is seafood. So, one would think, clams and tomato juice wouldnt be a problem. WELL. I made my own bloody caesar with CLAMATO at home. A touch of cracked pepper, hot sauce, old bay seasoning. And it was FANTASTIC!;5.0;524;155
525;Price is good!;This is a good price on this item. This review was collected as part of a promotion.;5.0;525;155
526;Good;Nice;5.0;526;155

531;Clamato;Addictively tasty!;5.0;531;155
532;I love this;I love this product as I have chronic kidney disease and it is allowed for me. I only wish that I could find a coupon for it like i do for V8 that isnt good for me;5.0;532;155
533;My absolute favorite;I really like Clamato juice! I tried it because I thought that the savory notes of clam juice would be refreshing, and it really is the most delicious, refreshing, salty drink ever. Ive made sure to always keep a bottle in the fridge.;5.0;533;155
534;GZ;Very good!;5.0;534;155
535;love at first taste;I fell in love with Clamato over 30 yrs ago. My mom drank it and so i was introduced to it at a young age. Now as an adult i absolutely love it alone or mixing it up for some micheladas with my pops! We always have at least 2 bottles in the fridge!;5.0;535;155
536;Love it;I have been drinking Clamato for years and using it as a mixer for years. Nothing else compares. Bring back Beefmoto;5.0;536;155
537;My Review for Original Tomato Cocktail;I have diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease and I love Clamato Juice Cocktail and it is good for my kidney AND my diabetes. I have at least one glass a day.;5.0;537;155
538;Clamato juice;Very refreshing served iced cold.;5.0;538;155
539;Clamazing!! The clamax of my day;Best item I have ever purchased, hands down. So delicious, words cant do it justice. My favorite part is the clams, and also the tomato. How is it possible to unite two vastly different flavor a in such a harmonizing blend I dont know, but the result is beautiful and so delicious. I will definitely purchase again. Actually I am on the way right now. Walmart that is. To buy Clamato.;5.0;539;155
540;Yummy and refreshing!;Clamato does not have a distinct clam flavor its refreshing and with a nice balance to the tomato and clam and lime and spices. Its a nice alternative to V8 or tomato juice and works well in a cocktail blend.;5.0;540;155
541;Great Taste;This is my favorite beverage. Do not be afraid of the clam and tomato mix, it is fantastic. We drink a container per week. Some as Bloody Mary (Caesar). It has to be popular because Walmart is frequently sold out! I have tried the picante version, but the original is the best.;5.0;541;155
542;Tastes great;Makes great bloody marys;5.0;542;155
543;Clamato;The Clamato Cocktail is the best juice i have tasted in a long time. I have a small glass with every dinner. Good flavor, Great Taste.;5.0;543;155
544;Clamato;This is the absolute best tomato juice to use in a Bloody Mary. Because it contains clam juice, the drink is called a clam digger. Buy this all the time. Mix it with vodka, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice and hot sauce. Best drink.;5.0;544;155
545;so glad you can buy it here now;Being from Canada it so so good to see Motts Clamato juice was available at Walmart. We all know you cant make a Ceasar without it, There is a difference. A Ceasar is made with Clamato juice, a Bloody Mary is with tomato juice.;5.0;545;155
546;Refreshing;I didnt like the idea of clam and tomato juice, but tried it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with its refreshing taste. Whether it is served over ice, or as a part of a mixed drink, it is excellent.;5.0;546;155
547;Clamato coctail;Is good by its self or added to your favorite hop beverage :);4.0;267;155
548;Delicious;I only use Clamoto for my shrimp Cocteaus and drinks. Love the freshness;5.0;548;155
549;Best Virgin Bloody Mary;I love Clamato. I cant have alcohol due to health issues, but I make a mean virgin drink. Add celery salt and a couple squeezes of lime juice. Stir with a celery stalk. Yum!!!;5.0;549;155
550;great for red beer on a hot day;Great value on this size bottle;5.0;550;155
551;Delicious;Its far from natural, ( clam powder). But delicious.;5.0;551;155
552;good drink;This is good as drinking alone or mixing with your choice of other beverages.;4.0;552;155
553;Husband loves this;My husband loves to use this as an ingredient for Mexican shrimp cocktail its delicious. He also enjoys to drink it alone.;5.0;553;155
554;Clamato;Love this stuff. Very tasty!;5.0;554;155
555;Smooth;Very smooth and light flavor was a hit the town at the end I love become the clam and tomato blend with in this product;5.0;555;155
556;Great breakfast juice;I have been a user of clamato for quite a while. I was glad to find I could order it from walmart online as it is not always available in our store.;5.0;556;155
557;Clamato;Excellent flavor - I drink it by itself, but mostly I use this to make my Bloody Marys !!!;5.0;557;155
558;I love it;I love to buy clamato at Walmart the price is very good and the product is good I buy it for my micheladas;5.0;558;155
559;Proudly Flavored With Clams;Clamato almost seems like they are embarrassed this great Cocktail is seasoned with Clams (I wish there were more Clam Juice in it), as they never mention that part of the name sake. Be proud you created such an awesome drink and it is indeed seasoned with Clam Juice.....Put more in please!!;5.0;559;155
560;Clamato juice;I buy my mom the clamato juice she loves it . It makes her happy. I have never tried it maybe some day I will;;560;155
561;We love coco real!!!;This is great. We use cream of coconut often. We hate to have to buy cans that we can save after use. This coco real product allows to use the amount needed and save the rest. The taste of Coco Real is wonderful. Weve used it for drinks and even on burgers. Never a complaint.;5.0;561;156
562;The best;I love a good champagne cocktail and this brand of bitters is MUCH better than the bitters found at the grocery store.;;562;157
563;Bitters are the cure for whatever ails you...;Peychauds is a great way to expand your bitters collection, especially if all you have is the classic Angostura.Its got some nice anise, cherry and other notes in there, and is perfect for a wide variety of cocktails. You cant always use it as a straight up exchange for Angostura, but a lot of times you can. Itll give your cocktail a whole different stir.But why stop at alcoholic drinks Use bitters in all kinds of beverages, both soft and hard.A few dashes of Peychauds in your root beer or cola will transform it into something sublime. The usually muted vanilla and caramel aromatics will really burst forth.And the perfect hangover cure is lots of bitters and soda.Grab a bottle and dont let it get dusty on your shelf!;;563;157
564;The best!;I love a good champagne cocktail and this brand of bitters is MUCH better than the bitters found at the grocery store.;;562;157
565;Great bitters.;I needed this to make my new favorite cocktail, (sazeracs) and it is a great product. Hard to find but leave it to Amazon to come through once again. The service and shipping was very fast also.;;565;157
566;Need some for Sazeracs, great in Manhattans;If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need:Orange BittersPeach BittersLemon BittersOld Fashioned (Angostura-type) BittersPeychauds BittersJaegermeisterCampariUnicumYou cant get Peychauds bitters anywhere else...nothing else compares. I think its one of the most versatile bitters there is. Is great as a digestif, too. I like it more than Underbergs as a digestif.;;566;157
567;Excellent for making a Sazerac;A must for a Sazerac.-3 oz rye whiskey-3/4 oz simple syrup-Peychaud bitters to taste-absinthe or absinthe substitute-Lemon twist for garnish;;567;157
568;Great product, but it may not be the one you are looking for;If you are looking for bitters for an old fashioned, manhattan, or any other drink that simply says bitters in the recipe, this is probably not what you want. Peychauds bitters taste very different than angostura bitters, as they have a character that tastes more like anise, absinthe, or black licorice. If that is indeed what you are looking for, for a drink such a sazerac, then you are in the right place. This bottle is 10oz, which is the larger size, and will indeed make many sazeracs.;;568;157
569;Taste of Old New Orleans;Peychauds Bitters is the defining ingredient in the classic New Orleans cocktail known as the Sazerac, allegedly the first cocktail invented in the U.S., dating to the pre-Civil War period.As such, theres no substitute! It lends a mildly bitter taste and a sophisticated aroma to any beverage. In addition to mixing it for Sazeracs (check on line for various recipe versions), I add 7 - 10 drops to an iced glass of tonic or lemon-lime soda when I want a super-low-alcohol beverage with the taste of an alcohol cocktail. I find it soothes both the nerves and the digestive system.;;569;157
570;Sazerac. Anything else;This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar. They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesnt show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping. Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size. I dont think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to Absinthe Cocktails by Kate Simon). Ill keep looking for other uses...;;570;157
571;Sazarac Bar at Home;One doesnt need to travel to New Orleans for the perfect Sazarac. Make it with this ingredient, along with some good rye whiskey. This is also good in iced tea....mmmmm!;;571;157
572;Must have;Adds a nice flavor to manhattans. Lots of flavor. I use Peychauds with other bitters in ice water for a great 0 calorie drink. Vary the amounts of each for a well rounded drink. Peychauds can be used alone because it has the high, medium and base flavor notes. Try it.;;572;157
573;Adds more appeal to drinks;Good stuff, adds interest to many otherwise ordinary cocktails. Im still experimenting with this one, but so far Ive used it in many drink recipes it seems to go especially well with sweet drinks.;;573;157
574;Great bitters.;I needed this to make my new favorite cocktail, (sazeracs) and it is a great product. Hard to find but leave it to Amazon to come through once again. The service and shipping was very fast also.;;574;157

577;It is what it it is;The mix inside the container smells very similar to kool aid. It is a good sugary drink mix when access to a blender or the time to make a homemade product is unavailable. Its decent for the price though my guest seemed to like it. A word of caution before pouring anything into the bucket carefully inspect the bottom of the bucket and spout for damage. On one of these my bucket was uknowlingly damaged and I lost a substantial amount as my margarita dripped out into the freezer. - Cheers;3.0;577;158

624;Some like it hot;So good. I like the hotter bourbons, and at 120+, there is nothing better at this price point. This is like a Stagg Jr that you can actually find at retail price, or find at all. Underrated, and I just assume it stays that way.;5.0;624;162
625;From scotch to bourbon;I AM A SINGLE MALT SCOTCH AFICIANADO. RECENTLY I HAVE DECIDED TO EMBRACE MY AMERICAN HERITAGE BY TRYING BOURBONS. IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, I HAD THE SUSPICION, THAT SUCH NATIONALISTIC IDEALS ARE DOOMED TO FAIL BUT OH MY GOODNESS! THE KNOB CREEK KENTUCKY STRAIGHT IS EVERYTHING I HAVE DESIRED! RICH, MELLOW, FRUITY, AND SUFFICIENTLY HEAVY TO KEEP ME LIGHT.;4.0;625;162
626;Smooth operator;Knob creek has become my go-to. mixed with ginger ale or straight, you cant go wrong with knob creeks kentucky straight bourbon whiskey.;5.0;626;162
627;A pleasure to drink;one of my simple pleasures in life is a Knob Creek 100 proof on the rocks. it is fantastic.;5.0;627;162
628;Finally GOT a bottle;I have loved it since the first time I tried it. However, in my country its not sold. In a recent trip abroad, I finally found it and bought a bottle. Now Im looking forward to share it with friends. Wonderful bourbon!;5.0;628;162
629;Smooth;Straight or on ice, smooth and no bite.;5.0;629;162
630;Ive already put aside Makers and Woodford.;From the first sniff in the glass to finally reaching my lips. Aaa+++ Bourbon!!!! Very happy with my purchase. Ive already told my buddies to come by for a taste.;5.0;630;162
631;Sweet and good burn;For 100 Proof, this bourbon is sweet and mellow. The slight burn at the finish reminds you that you are still alive.;5.0;631;162
632;Something has changed;Previous bottles stated aged nine years. Last bottle purchased shows no age. Taste appeared a little harsher than previously.;2.0;632;162
633;Highly recommend!;This is a superb quality whiskey. My go to!;5.0;633;162
634;Great recommendation. Great Bourbon. Great price.;This is a go-to bourbon for me. A friend recommended the 9 year as a good, full bodied bourbon at a really good price...and needless to say...it didnt disappoint. I typically have either neat or at times over an (oversized) ice cube. Either way, I get really good, smooth flavors (somewhat woody, somewhat caramel-ly) and enjoy it on a regular basis. I consider this to be one the best Bourbons for a really good price.;5.0;634;162
635;The type of honest whiskey a man respects.;A bright amber dram that is bold yet soft on the back of the tongue and lights a fire on the way down. The nose is a velvety riot of vanilla and caramel that finishes with a hint of sour mash. It is the kind of whiskey that a man would choose to enjoy after a hunt or after a wake to remember good times and good friends.;5.0;635;162
636;Wow!;Wow! What a punch! Yet smooth enough to enjoy.;5.0;636;162
637;nice knockoff;This tastes great for the price and is as close to the captain as I have found.;4.0;637;163
638;Sweet Bubbly;I bought 16 of these for a small wedding dinner. Went over well. This is a standard sweet sparkling Asti with consistent quality and reasonable price year after year.;4.0;638;164
639;Very good;Good price and product;5.0;639;164
640;Better Than Soda;light crispy flavor, very refreshing add a little salt and it is perfect;5.0;640;165
641;REALLY GOOD;This tastes amazing, so far the best from Jaspers.The magic potion is just annoying to brew with. When you add it to the beer it turns into a mucusy substance and you need to strain it out which is really hard. Other than that it is great!;4.0;641;166
642;Awesome delivery 4 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No;I havent had a chance to brew this beer, but everything about the process has been great so far. They are in state, so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb. The kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain - but its important. Funny detail, and gives me a sense of their personality. Also, due to this specific brew - you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine. Spice, malts, sweetness. Ughhhh. I keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed.The actual product itself is quite comprehensive - best kit Ive purchased thus far. It comes with stickers for your bottle caps, (great idea guys!), was comparatively priced against competitors beers, a large bag of liquid malt, a smaller bag of dry malt, a can of pumpkin pie mix (debating tossing in another can on my own), brown sugar, a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon, bittering hops, cheesecloth, priming sugar and dry yeast. Wow. Excellent care in their product for an absolutely appropriate price.I Cannot WAIT to brew this beer, and I absolutely anticipate doing a lot more business with Jaspers.;5.0;642;166

Despite my rookie mistake by moving it to secondary fermentation after active fermentation was over it was a forgiving beer. Carbonation was slow but at 7 weeks its maturing into a tasty, wickedly good beer. Mouth feel and foamy head throughout (yes I hear the snickers) but a fantastic beer.

647;Nice kit, but...;I bought two of these kits to make ten gallons. After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primarys I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. Its got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. Im not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good. The abv came out at about 6.9 after adding an extra pound of dextrose.I expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking.;3.0;647;166

656;Get your moneys worth.;This is a really well thought out beer kit. Good instructions and fresh quality components. A kit like this would cost a lot more from a competitor, and probably would have lesser quality components. I will purchase more kits from this seller.;;656;166

676;Great Tortilla Strips;These Tortilla Strips have a great flavor and pare well with salads and soups. I enjoy the added flavor to any type of salad! They are so good in a bowl of soup and remain crispy longer than you woukd expect!;5.0;676;168
677;Ok, not great.;I have had better strips. When I opened package found them slightly stale... Sure enough check the expire date Oct 2015. Well shoot, bought in Oct. I should have known better. Used them in soup and tossed the rest.;3.0;677;168

680;Solid tequila;My buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game. Frankly when it comes to tequila, I usually brace myself for a rough shot. Maybe Im drinking the wrong stuff, because this was really easy to put back. No lingering aftertaste. Reasonably priced. Good value tequila if youre looking.;5.0;106;169
681;One of my favorite!;Straight over ice.;5.0;107;169
682;Magnificent oak flavor!;Im a single malt Scotch guy. I generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week. On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor. It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price. Youve got a customer for life!;5.0;188;170
683;My favorite bourbon!;Exceptionally good flavor!;5.0;189;170

688;I love Jim Bean;I first started drinking Jim Bean when i went camping. I didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean. My first was Red Stag Cherry. Than i tried devils cut when i came home. I have been hooked ever since. I usually mix with coke or dr.pepper.;5.0;194;170
689;Best bourbon under 50;This is the best bourbon under 50 you can buy. One of the smoothest bourbons Ive tasted. I typically drink Woodford Reserve or Eagle Rare until I tried this. I buy a bottle every two weeks now.;5.0;195;170
690;I would definitely buy this quality bourbon again;This is Beam at its best very smooth.;5.0;196;170
691;Just the best!!;I tried JB Black for the first time tonight. It is so smooth. We made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome. Thanks Jim Beam for this awesome bourbon!!!;5.0;197;170
692;Love it, cannot find it anywhere;I have been enjoying JB Black for the past three years. The has all the flavor os a higher proof, bur 86, I can have another without collapsing. Now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area. What happened The double oaked is OK, but no match for the black. Where can I find it in Sonoma County, California;5.0;198;170
693;Jim Beam at its best!;I bought this in early December and it didnt make it to the new year... This one is Awesome, keep up the great work!;5.0;199;170

695;They screwed up;We have ordered these several times. But this will be the LAST time. The NEW RECIPE sucks they have very little to no flavor.;;695;171
696;Finally;Been hearing about this but never tried until I saw this in amazon and have a taste of it. Taste is subtle not as sweet.. If you like gummie candy this is worth a try. I will purchase these again;;696;171
697;Five Stars;Yummy;;697;171
698;everyone needs these;first time i ordered these and they are simply put...absolutly fantastic.. if you want a gummy with tang these are those. i have already ordered again as Pooi write this .the flavor is just yummy.;;698;171
699;You should try them;These are awesome. Better texture than gummies.Taste is subtle not as sweet.. If you like gummie candy this is worth a try.;;699;171
700;excellent;Ive eaten far too many already...these taste fruity, several fruit flavors, as good or better than any wine gums I had before. Highly recommend;;700;171
701;Five Stars;Yummy!;;697;171
702;Finally!!!;Been hearing about this but never tried until I saw this in amazon and have a taste of it. Taste is subtle not as sweet.. If you like gummie candy this is worth a try. I will purchase these again!;;696;171
703;Great taste and texture;These traditional winegums are soft, gummy drops that are similar to but chewier than jujubes. Each piece is imprinted with the name of a type of alcohol such as Port, Rum, Gin, Cider, and Cognac. However, the candies are entirely non-alcoholic, and the flavors are actually lemon, apple, orange, raspberry, and black currant. The overall taste is pleasantly tart.;;703;171
704;Wine gums;As far as gummy candy, these are fine. They have a good fruity flavor and good texture. As far as tasting like traditional wine gums, not so much.;;704;171
705;was disappointed. I have been a consistent purchaser (by subscription;I, too, was disappointed. I have been a consistent purchaser (by subscription, every 4 months) and these last order that came 2 weeks ago was different than all purchased previously - less sweet (they had been perfect) and harder texture which produced an overall less pleasing experience. Have no idea why they would change a formula that was close to perfect;;705;171
706;Gustavs New Formula Wine Gums - Theyre Terrible!!;I have ordered Gustavs wine gums many times from amazon and always been delighted with the product. Well imagine my surprise when I recently opened my latest order to discover a new formula product that bears no resemblance to the old. The wine gums are smaller, harder, much paler in color, and all colors have this same wretchedly super-sweet after-taste that just keeps on giving me something that I definitely do not want.Why has Gustav begun shipping a different product with no advance notice to its loyal customers Well this is one former customer who is definitely no longer loyal! Im stuck with 6.6kg. of these things and Im seriously tempted to throw them in the garbage.Smarten up, Gustavs! Refund my money for this inferior garbage, or ship me what I ordered - the original product. I dont want this crap. And Im betting nobody else does either.;;706;171
707;No Ginger In Ginger Ale;They dont state on the label how much ginger is in their ginger ale. I am to deduce that there isnt any, since they wont list it on the ingredients label.;1.0;707;172
708;Great Taste!;I bought the 7 oz cans to keep in refrigerator for nausea. It workes miracles and what a perfect size.;5.0;708;172
709;What Happened?;Love Canada Dry until about a month ago..every carton Ive purchased has been flat..no fizz..and just bad tasting..Ive used Canada Dry for years so certainly know good from bad. Has there been a change cause they surely dont taste good.;2.0;709;172
710;has real ginger!;I love your product! I dont drink pop (soda) but I drink your ginger ale for tummy upsets. I tried the cranberry one last night and loved the flavor!;;710;172
711;Great smooth taste;Refreshing, great taste, no artificial sweeteners.;;711;172
712;Wonderfully refreshing!;Weve enjoyed your products over the years. Having experienced some minor problems with an upset stomach recently, I was happy to have some on hand. For me, its the perfect pick me up for those times youre feeling a little under;;712;172
713;Refreshing;I have had Stage 4 Kidney Cancer for over 8 years and just discovered the delights of your bevarage last year and how it can stop nausea instantly!! It is also a refreshing change in summer from a cola!;;713;172
714;The BEST Ginger Ale;Always the best by far, great taste. I have loved it since I was a kid;;714;172
715;Awesome drink mixer!!;Alone or with vokda. Also, a lot of people arent aware it settles upset tummies because of the ginger quicker than the old standard cola and crackers!!!! Ive turned several people onto Canada Dry for both reasons!!;;715;172
716;Great ice cream sodas;Been making ice cream sodas for my family for 50 years!;;716;172
717;Refreshing;Not too sweet like some other drinks. Just refreshing!!!;;717;172
718;Fantastic drink;I absolutely love Canada Dry Ginger Ale..this is the only Ginger Ale that I will drink and have drank for the past 25 years..I have BAD acid reflux and have been hospitalized several times with this and them thinking I was having a heart attack..well every time they say its acid reflux..the last time I was in the hospital I asked for Ginger Ale and they said -you cant have anything with caffine and I said Canada Dry Ginger Ale has NO caffine..they said oh-we thought all soda had caffine...and I said Canada Dry is not just any soda-its Canada Dry! I got my Ginger Ale! It is the only drink we have in our house!;;718;172
719;Scuba divers favorite!;Its my favorite soda! It is great for preventing sea sickness too. Im a scuba diver and its the only thing I will drink on a dive boat. I prefer the plastic bottles and they are hard to find.;;719;172
720;Its my entergetic spark.;Speed up my epiglotttis to rush my food to my esophagus where they fall in love in my stomach and make happy and relaxed.;;720;172
721;Best prescription for what ails the stomach;I. Have a condition that causes daily nausea Nothing calms it better than a few sips of ice cold CD Ginger Ale. Perform S better than all other brands and the 2 prescription medications I havePTL even got a local store Harveys Supermarket ,,(Manager Irvin and Robin the Vendor. )on Edgewood Ave to order 3 cases a month of the 8 oxen Ounce bottles. Best store manager in town. Kudos to him Both of themPS...I was married on January 1, 1974 the age of 16. Our toast was Ginger Ale, although we are divorced now I along with my children and grandchildren still toast the new year xwith gingeale;;721;172
722;CD Ginger Ale;I love this. I made green punch last year for my nieces wedding reception with Lime Kool-Aid, pineapple juice and Canada Dry Ginger Ale. Ive been drinking CD Ginger Ale ever since.;;722;172
723;Its just GOOD!!!;I buy it in 2 liter , cases or single can or bottles. When I open a single can I drink it so fast while eating my lunch or dinner. I purchased 4 cases for Christmas dinner an they were gone before the Coke and Pepsi drinks.We love it!!!!;;723;172
724;A Refreshing Pause;A year ago, as I was experiencing stomach problems, a friend suggested drinking Ginger Ale for the real ginger in it and its medicinal properties. I started doing so and although I no longer experience the stomach problems, Canada Dry Ginger Ale has become my go to beverage. I find myself being disappointed when Im in a food establishment that doesnt serve it.;;724;172
725;good for keeping tummy settled;I am always sick after i have surgery . Was told to drink alot of ginger ale before i had it done and it really helped alot.love it;;725;172
726;Memories;I was raised on Canada Dry Ginger Ale. I didnt know anything about Coke/Pepsi in the 1950s. Still love the flavor!;;726;172
727;Refreshing !;This is the only soda I drink ! I love it because it is refreshing and helps my stomach !;;727;172

731;Yummy!;These are so yummy! They are great with pasta! I also like them with soup kinda like a grilled cheese but less mess and work. I would recommend under cooking just slightly so they are soft and cheesy;;731;174

736;not enough;The bread sticks are awsome but there is only 5 in the package. I wouldnt buy it again only because there isnt enough for the cost;;736;174
737;Great with Italian;These are delicious and extremely easy to prepare - just pop them in the oven! The only complaint I have is that there are only five in the box. I wish I could get a box of ten, because we eat these a couple of times a week and the boxes take up lots of room in the freezer. Otherwise, these are delicious!;;737;174

761;Love, love;Delivered on time, as expected. Love, love, love Goslings Diet Ginger Beer. So happy to get it in the states, although a trip to Bermuda is pretty awesome.;;761;180
762;Just returned from Bermuda with some Stormy Ginger Beer. ...;Just returned from Bermuda with some Stormy Ginger Beer. Have to watch sugar intake so back at home I bought diet Stormy and did a side by side comparison. Confirmed the reviews that indicated that diet Stormy has noticeably less ginger flavor. I found a local source for Barritts diet ginger beer (made in Bermuda and preceded Goslings ginger beer) and did a side by side comparison against diet Stormy. The diet Barritts had noticeably more ginger flavor.;;762;180
763;Pricey here;Tastes great, hardly like diet. Great and intense ginger taste but expensive on this site I get it in the liquor store for about a buck a can.;;763;180
764;Goslings inferior diet ginger beer;I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice. Although I highly doubt it, Goslings diet ginger beer may be the superior product for use in Dark n Stormy or Moscow Mule cocktails.;;764;180
765;Great if you prefer dry vs. sweet;I love ginger beer. This one is among the drier varieties, so it is light, crisp and refreshing. I would recommend this one for mixing lower calorie drinks. Great ginger flavor. I would buy this again.;;765;180
766;Disappointed;I bought this from a local store to make Moscow Mules, and I know Goslings is more about the Dark and Stormy, but I have to say I was very disappointed in this product. It didnt have as strong of ginger bite as I was looking for, but I guess thats what I get for going diet. I will stick to Royals from now on.;;766;180
767;Tastes so good!;Ginger Beer is hard to find where I live and to mention diet, its impossible! I love the taste of this brand and will continue to puchase.;;767;180

Its light amber appearance, sweet, woody, mossy nose, and its mild moss, white oak, mellow wintergreen mint, and dried, faintly-candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin-point distilling execution. Jim Beam Original has a gradual finish, with a ghost of chocolate powder, during the fade out. Highly recommended. RJT;5.0;85;183

791;Just ordered this beer kit excited to brew it up ...;Just ordered this beer kit excited to brew it up and try it. This is my first partial grain batch;;791;188
792;Never judge a book by its cover, because this Irish Red is amazing;I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. Its not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). Id purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Reds.;;792;188

867;Heavenly root beer! Clean ingredients, non gmo!;This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but its sold out a lot! The ingredients are clean and natural, while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients, caramel color. I quit drinking traditional sodas years ago, because of the nasty ingredients and taste. Virgils is absolute heaven in a root beer float. Virgils root beer is micro brewed, smooth and creamy and I am addicted to it, I think. Its worth every penny.Description and ingredients:Virgils is a superb blend of spices and herbs gathered from the world over anise, licorice, vanilla (bourbon), cinnamon, clove, wintergreen, sweet birch, molasses, nutmeg, pimento berry oil, balsam oil and cassia oil.Ingredients: Purified carbonated water, unbleached cane sugar, caramelized unrefined cane sugar, citric acid, herbs and spices!

868;Very Good, But Needs A Few Changes.;Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgils Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgils is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgils RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz.

876;Stella Rosa Moscato DAsti is the best white wine;I absolutely love this wine. With Moscato DAsti being my favorite, I have tried several brands. Stella Rosa is my absolute favorite. I wont try any others. Its crisp and sweet with no icky aftertaste. I love it!;5.0;876;200
877;Yummy;Very good sweet moscato;5.0;877;200

879;Lasts a good 12 hours;;5.0;879;202
880;Not As Sweet;For those of you who want to enjoy a nice beverage that is not as sweet, try this mix. My husband has been purchasing this for some time now. Added to that, we pay the 50 yearly one time purchase to have future items from Walmart shipped to your home free. So worth the cost.;5.0;880;203
881;;This product seems to help my liver if I take it before eating.;3.0;881;204
882;;Very happy to get more bitters in my diet, and they are organic!;5.0;882;204
883;functional, but not great;this didnt taste like olive juice from an actual jar of olives. it tasted a bit sweeter or like it was synthetic. i wouldnt recommend.;2.0;883;205
884;Best product I wont buy online again;I really like this product - its the best out there. However, the combination of the occasional bad (mold) bottle, and the glass breakage/leaking, for the price point its not worth the hassle. If I can buy it locally I will, otherwise I have to give up on Dirty Sue :-(;3.0;884;205
885;A must buy.;Way better then using juice from the olives. Best martinis i have made yet.;5.0;885;205
886;Never enough brine in the olive jar. . .;Great addition to my martini Monday . . .;4.0;886;205
887;This stuff is the goods!;Absolutely perfect. Will reorder often.;5.0;887;205
888;Makes a delicious martini;Really good stuff!!;5.0;888;205
889;Four Stars;Hubby says its ok, but he prefers the olive juice in a jar of olives.;4.0;889;205

891;Five Stars;great stuff!;5.0;891;205
892;Four Stars;Very satisfied;4.0;892;205
893;This stuff rocks!;I cant even drink a dirty martini anymore if I dont have Dirty Sue. I use a shot of it in Bloody Marys too. There is no comparison to the juice found in olive jars... this stuff is like the top-shelf of olive brine. I highly recommend it!;;893;205
894;Slurp.... aaaaaaahhhhhhh;I like martinis about as dirty as they can come. This stuff is just the bomb! Its so much more flavorful than any olive juice Ive tasted from olives in a jar. Its full bodied, not just briny.Go ahead.... youre DEFINITELY worth it.!;;894;205
895;Mixer Madness;This is just what I have been looking for..as a lover of a good strong dirty martini I am known for having a refer full of juiceless olive jars. Dirty Sue was truly a find. I keep plenty of it stocked enough to share with my fiends and even those mere acquaintances that stop by.;;895;205
896;Yum.;Delicious. I recently went through a dirty martini phase and was frustrated with the inconsistent quality of my drinks. Some were fabulous while others tasted outright disgusting. A waste of precious quality vodka. I quickly figured out that for me, only salt brines will do. No vinegar.I was discarding a lot of expensive olives for the sake of a few drinks and thought surely there must be a source for brine only. I read reviews and ingredient lists until finding Dirty Sue. This product aint cheap (its salt water after all) but I was not disappointed. Like I said before, NO VINEGAR. Im very pleased. Will be purchasing several bottles for Christmas and pairing them with a nice Vodka as gifts.;;896;205
897;Awesome stuff;If you want to make a good dirty martini, this is the stuff that is going to help you. It is the only Olive Juice my husband will take in his martinis and really the only one we ever have on hand always. Because we do entertain a lot, this gets bought often and is enjoyed by all.;;897;205
898;Best Ive tried!;I have been a dirty martini drinker for years and Ive never been able to find a good olive juice. Other brands claim to be 100 olive juice and they are really just glorified salt water. Dirty Sue is pure olive juice in a bottle. Or should I say pure magic in a bottle. I have a bottle of Dirty Sue in my fridge and a bottle of Ketel One in my freezer and I am a happy man.;;898;205
899;AMAZING!!!;If you like dirty martinis, this is the only way to go! The tasteis outta this world and its a superior juice than the stuff thatcomes in olive jars to preserve the olives. Ask for it at your local bar!!;;899;205
900;Why couldnt I have thought of this!;This product is great! I am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in Hollywood, CA and I was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives. Its a huge waste of time, and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately. Once I discovered Dirty Sue, not only did it fix these problems, but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice. Lets face it, if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini, why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it;;900;205

933;Suprisingly good!;I liked all of the favors. I was pleasantly surprised that these didnt have that no calorie drink aftertaste.

934;Not sweet, not martinis--salty Tequila/Margaritas;I like the Modern Cocktail packs, but was a little misled by the description for this one on Amazon.Possibly not the manufacturers fault - their package description is spot on.On Amazon it says something like add gin or vodka for Martinis and other similar drinks.But this one is all formulated for Tequila - all the drinks are Margaritas or other tequila drinks.Instead of the sugar that comes with the other drinks, this one comes with salt.I am not saying its bad - for 0 calories, obviously they couldnt use sugar. but i just assumed they would be just like the other mixes but made with nutrisweet or something.As long as you know what to expect - a much less sweet drink that goes better with tequila salt - then they are fine. of course, you can put whatever liquor you want in there, but i tried one with vodka and it just tasted odd to me.Here is exactly what the drinks are: Mango Skinny Margarita, Blood Orange Tequila Sunrise, Classic Skinny Margarita, Strawberry Tequila Lemonade, Acai Blueberry Skinny Margarita.;3.0;934;206
935;An invigorating assault upon the tongue-meats;This is a good product to acquire via commerce if you are desperate for a liquid to possess. It can be placed in a container. Swallowing it is possible. It can go in your mouth region. Alcohol is intended to go into it, and I personally recommend that you dilute these liquids with booze flavors. The boozeahol can help to momentarily distract you from the uncomfortable truth that the acai blueberry fluid tastes like you hijacked the Smurfs Winnebago and put its tire in your mouth. All in all, these liquids do not contain dangerous solids which may choke you, so they successfully could be considered fluid. Drink them. Or else.;5.0;935;206

949;Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water;My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagrams. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendricks Gin and it was good, better than Hendricks in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.;;949;209
950;I love Fever-Tree!;After doing an Internet search for tonic waters that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, I only found few options. The reviews for Fever-Tree were so positive that I decided to give it a try. They reviews are right: this tonic water is amazing! I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and Ts, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, its actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle. Schweppes is also FULL of sodium, and Fever-Tree is not. Check this tonic water out: youll be glad you did!!;;950;209
951;You dont smell it son, you drink it.;Man oh man, I love Fever Trees Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didnt just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.Theres a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. (1 Nephi 8:12)If you like it, youll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesnt have it. Trader Joes doesnt have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you! Let the sakura petals fall and the joy pebble dance commence!;;951;209
952;This is such a painful review to write..........;These were once the best Ginger Beers in the world. Nothing else even came close. I had been buying these by the case for years from Amazon (sometimes as many as 1-3 cases per month)! They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well. He said that it was obvious that the factory thought it was still making Tonic Water and let Quinine or whatever makes up tonic, run into these instead of natural spring water, as always used. That would explain the strange and unrecognizable bitterness. All I knew is that I was now stuck with three cases of stuff that tasted awful.I contacted Fever Tree directly to make them aware of this problem, as well as Brands Of Britain, who is the sole, authorized, distributor here in the United States.Read more;;952;209

Was this review helpful to you Yes No;Really liked this ginger beer when I discovered it a few years ago. While the ingredients on the label remain the same, the recipie has been changed. The suspended particulates of ginger are gone as is the strong ginger flavor. Tastes better than common ginger ale, but not as good as it was up until last year. No longer worth the premium price. This will be the last Fever Tree ginger beer case I buy. Will keep buying tonic though. Side by side pic posted in product pictures section.;;953;209

Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendricks Gin and it was good, better than Hendricks in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.;;949;209
960;This is such a painful review to write.......... 543 of 622 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No;These were once the best Ginger Beers in the world. Nothing else even came close. I had been buying these by the case for years from Amazon (sometimes as many as 1-3 cases per month)! They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well. He said that it was obvious that the factory thought it was still making Tonic Water and let Quinine or whatever makes up tonic, run into these instead of natural spring water, as always used. That would explain the strange and unrecognizable bitterness. All I knew is that I was now stuck with three cases of stuff that tasted awful.I contacted Fever Tree directly to make them aware of this problem, as well as Brands Of Britain, who is the sole, authorized, distributor here in the United States.Read more;;952;209

962;The BEST English Muffins;Cobblestone Bread Co. Original English Muffins are wonderful for breakfast sandwiches. Toasted and spread with butter and drizzled with honey or jam, What can I say Not enough for sure. You have to try them. Maybe for lunch with chicken salad Or a BLT when tomatoes are ripe and juicy. Any way, they are the BEST!;5.0;962;210
963;I like it;I like these better than Thomas English Muffins. The texture and pre-slitting is better.;4.0;963;210
964;should it be;Cobblestone English Muffins, Wheat, 6ct. Are they spose to be SO Doughy Hard to slice cuz the doughy inside balls-up. Taste very good, (only after toasting till the edges burn);3.0;964;210
965;Great Price and as good as the big name brand;These English Muffins are very good and they are half the price of others.;5.0;965;210
966;These are REAL English Muffins;I love the Cobblestone Original English Muffins. Being from New England, these are the type of English Muffins I am used to. I dont like those other ones with the nooks and crannies. In New England, you can find this type in every grocery store, not necessarily the Cobblestone brand. Its hard to find this type in the south. Seems like they only sell Thomass which are gross. Sometimes I can find these at Food Lion but my Walmart doesnt even have a spot on the shelf.;5.0;966;210
967;Watch out Thomass;This product is as good as if not better. Stays fresher longer and their other products are very good as well.;5.0;967;210
968;These are excellent English Muffins;Bought these just to try them out.... they were great... flavorful, crispy when lightly toasted.. we will definitely buy them again.;5.0;968;210
969;great enhlish muffins;first time trying these... really good;5.0;969;210
970;English muffins;Great much better than the name brand;4.0;210;210
971;Great;Doesnt have nooks and crannies but for the price I really enjoy them.;5.0;971;210
972;Hard;Not soft like Orowheat!!;2.0;972;210
973;Great everyday wine;Dry enough but not overpowering.;4.0;973;211
974;Great Every Day Wine;This Chardonnay pairs great with all types of meals and also seems to appease all wine drinkers. Good choice for large gatherings. Great value and guests are happy with the quality.;4.0;974;212
975;Great product - needs safer packaging;This is my favorite brand and size...........I drink it instead of V-8 for breakfast, along with an occasional true Bloody Mary when I am entertaining friends. My only complaint is the delivery packaging of a pack of 6 - the box was delivered upside down and was ripped - the contents, thankfully, were not damaged. It would help if the outer box was labeled THIS SIDE UP !!;5.0;975;213
976;Bloody Marry Mx;I love this product and drink usually an 8 oz bottle daily with nothing in it but the mix. It is like Snappy Tom but I like it better. The last time I ordered a case of it and it is almost gone already. If you like a spicy tomato drink I highly recommend it.;5.0;976;213
977;Its delicious;I love this and drink it without alcohol every day. But, it is practically non existent in the stores. You can find Bold Spicy but not this. And why does this cost almost 2.00 more per bottle then the Bold Spicy;5.0;977;213
978;Its that easy!!!;Hi, this is Cocktail Artist Robert Porter. First, Id like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What Ive done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes its that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesnt have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create. Make the glass your canvas, mix it like you mean it. Robert.;5.0;978;214
979;Awesomeness;OMG....Love, Love the best cocktail mix ever!!!! A must try for everyone, Dont miss out!;5.0;979;214
980;Demeter couldnt make a better mix!;Although I dont feel its necessary to describe how angels came down from heaven to squeeze tiny droplets of Nirvana into a bottle to be sold across the country in retailers under this brand and recipe... I feel I will be expressing this to everyone I meet until the bitter end of my life. This mix... this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy ... is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream I need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends. Its that freaking good folks... buy it... buy cases of it... snort it, drink it, shoot it, whatever you do ... just try it! Once you do youll be on here leaving another depraved review... hopefully three times more twisted than mine! God Speed. God Speed.;5.0;311;214
981;A New Spin On An Old Classic;After finding out that I was hosting an impromptu b-day party for a friend I scrambled knowing that my beverage knowledge was very basic, limited to essentially beer, wine and liquor/soda. Further, I knew that I would soon host several liquor pros, including those that would size-up my novice bartending abilities. Enter the Cocktail Artist Essential Bar Ingredients Premium Manhattan Mix. Making my pre-shindig trip to Walmart, I circled the aisles looking for something that could help me out. I came across a bottle of this liquid magic which allowed me to craft top-notch Manhattans. To this day, I still am asked by party patrons what was my secret recipe, go figure! If you need instant bartender credibility for your next soire, look no further than this life-saver.;5.0;981;214
982;Pleasantly surprised;Bought this on a whim last minute for a dinner party and was very pleasantly surprised . ...tried it with both bourbon (bulleit) and rye (rittenhouse) and both came out great. It has a nice citrusyness that brings all the flavors together quite nicely and it wasnt too sweet or syrupy or artificial tasting at all. Loved this product and will definitely be making it a staple in my home bar...cant wait to sample the other products in their line as well;5.0;982;214
983;LOVE LOVE LOVE!;The BEST easiest manhatten EVER! Was such a great mix to have for our diy cocktail party! Now its always in our bar at home! Sometimes you just need a fancy drink;5.0;983;214
984;Total game changer!;Best cocktail product ever! My husband is a 33yr career bartender this changed his game, it is now the staple of his bar. Its so smooth light, makes it impossible to have just 1:-);5.0;984;214
985;Natural ingredients, great flavor!!!;Im very impressed with the fact that this Mannhattan Mix represented by Robert Porter, has natural ingredients, and is not laden with fake chemicals. I prefer my drinks to taste real, fresh and balanced, and this mix is a lovely complement to my whiskey of choice. I highly recommend this mix!;5.0;985;214
986;Delicious!!;This is amazing!! I was shocked by how smooth, and tasty it was!! Usually I do not buy cocktail mixes but a friend recommended this one to me, and I am so glad she did. I love it! It will defiantly be a staple in my home and parties!!;5.0;986;214
987;Best Manhattan mix!;I have to say I never thought of buying a mix like this, but it is so tasty and delicious! All you have to do is add your favorite whiskey and some Robert Porter over ice. Super easy manhattan and very smooth, and tastes amazing! Highly recommended.;5.0;987;214
988;AMAZING!!!;I wasnt too sure about this at first because it was so inexpensive...but thought Id give it a shot. It far exceeded all expectations!!! So delicious and smooth!!! Super impressed! Plus it doesnt hurt that the guy on the bottle is cute...just sayin;5.0;988;214
989;Take home and taste some class in a glass.;This is a superb drink for those days you dont feel like getting dressed for that upscale bar downtown. Invite a friend and share this cocktail at home. This is an elegant drink for those with a sophisticated palate. This cocktail will now be a staple in my home bar.;5.0;989;214
990;Do yourself a favor and purchase;Not personally into pre made mixes, but bought this for entertaining friends the other night. Was extremely impressed! So smooth and balanced! Everyone LOVED their manhattans! All you have to do is add your whiskey or bourbon of choice. There are no artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrups in the mix either. Just pure cane sugar. Honestly probably safer than using the liqueurs on the market! As a bartender myself Im telling you to get this product!!;5.0;990;214
991;Amazing Manhattan Mixer!!!;I used this Manhattan Mixer at our weekend pool party and it was an absolute hit!!! Cocktails were delicious and simple to make. It was one of the conversational pieces of the party!!!;5.0;991;214
992;Old-school delicious cocktail made simple!;This is great stuff! I wasnt sure what to expect before trying it, because its the first time Ive tried Manhattan Mix. It is so easy to make and even easier to drink. Delicious, smooth, wonderful on the palette. Next time Im in Im going to buy 6 of them, and also get some for my friends. Great stuff, please keep this in stock!;5.0;992;214
993;Great Mixer;Love this... great product!! Prefect for parties... graduation, summer bbqs...;4.0;993;214
994;THE BOMB.COM!!;Its a full bodied and delicious!! I use it at get together or just when Im needing that Manhattan at home after work!;5.0;994;214
995;Love this mix!;I am a fan of the Manhattan, although rarely do I buy a mix. However I decided to give this a try, the price couldnt be beat. Smooth taste, authentic to a true Manhattan. Just follow the directions on the bottle, simple as that. Its a great tasting mixer, in a good size bottle at a good price.;5.0;995;214
996;PERFECT DRINK;This was the best buy the Manhattan was perfect , tasty, and smooth. I was at a party and first tried the drink and went out and purchased for my party coming up. I had to share I think people will love love it!!;5.0;996;214

1001;Awesomeness In A Bottle!!;This product is so simple and easy to use !! Ive tried different manhatan mixes before and this one is by far my favorite! It meshes very well w any burbon and the flavors dont overpower and try to mask the burbon like other products !!! Its an essential to my mini bar at home !!AMAZING PRODUCT!!;5.0;1001;214
1002;Not necessary;I have a manhattan almost everyday after work. My wife bought me this to try and although it is decent, it is not necessary. Spend your money on quality vermouth and of course the best bourbon one can afford.;2.0;1002;214
1003;Great!!!;Ive already went through 5 bottles of this stuff! Great tasting and smooth... and so easy to make my favorite drink.. a manhattan! Definitely recommend this as a premium mixer.;5.0;1003;214

1006;Really good!!! Definitely try it.;So good! It really makes having a craft cocktail at home really easy. It is so hard to find natural products these days, especially mixers. I really love this one. The taste is excellent! Im going to try some of the other mixers now too. This one is definitely my new favorite mixer!;5.0;1006;214
1007;So good;I love this mix!! Its easy and taste delicious!!!!;5.0;1007;214

1019;Love this product!;Everything is great about this product, cheap price, perfect taste. Mixing this flavor with just a soda makes it delicious.;5.0;112;218
1020;Magnificent oak flavor!;Im a single malt Scotch guy. I generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week. On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor. It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price. Youve got a customer for life!;5.0;188;219
1021;My favorite bourbon!;Exceptionally good flavor!;5.0;189;219
1022;Top Choice Every Time!;No matter where I go after years of various bourbon tastings....Jim Beam Black is head and shoulders above the rest no matter what the price tag!;5.0;190;219
1023;Good Job;Im personally a wild turkey drinker. But cudos to Jim beam for producing such a classy commercial. Got the right girl to be their spokesperson. Good job. Very classy.;5.0;191;219
1024;When you want to experience perfection, look no further!;Seriously You ask whats great about it What isnt great about it;5.0;192;219
1025;What bourbon should be.;No explanation necessary.;5.0;193;219
1026;I love Jim Bean;I first started drinking Jim Bean when i went camping. I didnt want to carry the bear around so i tried jim bean. My first was Red Stag Cherry. Than i tried devils cut when i came home. I have been hooked ever since. I usually mix with coke or dr.pepper.;5.0;194;219
1027;Best bourbon under 50;This is the best bourbon under 50 you can buy. One of the smoothest bourbons Ive tasted. I typically drink Woodford Reserve or Eagle Rare until I tried this. I buy a bottle every two weeks now.;5.0;195;219
1028;I would definitely buy this quality bourbon again;This is Beam at its best very smooth.;5.0;196;219
1029;Just the best!!;I tried JB Black for the first time tonight. It is so smooth. We made whiskey sours with it and they were awesome. Thanks Jim Beam for this awesome bourbon!!!;5.0;197;219
1030;Love it, cannot find it anywhere;I have been enjoying JB Black for the past three years. The has all the flavor os a higher proof, bur 86, I can have another without collapsing. Now it has disappeared from even the most extensive liquor stores in my area. What happened The double oaked is OK, but no match for the black. Where can I find it in Sonoma County, California;5.0;198;219
1031;Jim Beam at its best!;I bought this in early December and it didnt make it to the new year... This one is Awesome, keep up the great work!;5.0;199;219
1032;Rich Aromatic;Absolutely love, love, love it!!;5.0;200;219
1033;Fabulous purchase;I really like how compact and easy to use this pressure washer is, would buy it again in an instant after using it.;5.0;1033;220
1034;Not bad;First off its not as powerful as the gas model I had but its not as bad as the other reviews describe. My gas model would peel paint. This one is not that strong. If you need something to wash and clean, it works fine on concrete and dirt. If you need to peel paint, get a gas one.;3.0;1034;220
1035;Awesome;I was lucky to purchase this power washer on sale for 99.99 . My patio and porch look like new. My drive way and sidewalks look new as well. I decided to power wash my house too. All with just water. Everything done in about 6 hours. Easy to use. Great investment great review. Barbecue pits are next.;5.0;1035;220
1036;Only lasted 2 years;I used this a lot to clean my wheel wells on my truck of road pack and the underside of my riding mower. I was disappointed to see that after only 2 years of use my pump developed a leak which would cost more to fix than than buying a new unit. I am retired and cant afford to buy one every 2 years but it looks like I will.;2.0;1036;220
1037;Not worth it.;If youre going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house, this is not worth the time or effort. The nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose.;2.0;1037;220
1038;Works great for household usage!;I also got this during Sams Spring sale. Having messed with my fathers 10 year old Electric pressure washer, I didnt have high hopes. I was looking for something inexpensive that would clean my driveway, grill and fence every so often. Yes, gas models are more powerful, but theyre more expensive and you need to maintain them. First off - the build quality. Seems rugged. Metal couplings for hoses (vs plastic for my dads old one). How well it does: Concrete was cleaned! The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean. Also had no issues cleaning my grill from 2 years of grease. Overall with a 2 year warranty Im pretty happy with this!;5.0;1038;220
1039;Power Washer;Bought, assembled, and used it to clean concrete with mold, mildew, and moss on it. Worked great.;5.0;1039;220
1040;The right pressure for most jobs;I got this to do a power washing job, and I love it. Its small yet powerful comes with a variety of different accessories that you would end up paying more money for.;4.0;1040;220
1041;enough power for my light duty needs!!!!;Sams Club is 99 percent pleasing with its all of its sales products. Everything from electrical, electronic, groceries, furniture, building products, recreational and mechanical etc... My black max pressure washer gets five stars and the sales price was the best! I recommended that my youngest son purchase one and he loves it too. Thanks, Sams Club;5.0;1041;220
1042;Great Value;Great electric pressure washer, the scrubber worked great on my patio.;5.0;1042;220
1043;Works Great;I purchased an electric model just to avoid another gas engine. This model works good cleaning our patio aggregate steps, walk driveway. Its light weight, easy to store priced accordingly.;5.0;1043;220
1044;Absolutely love it!;Im a woman who doesnt like to wait for her husband to help her do something. I can operate this by myself. I was surprised at how nicely it cleaned our composite decking. Our 40 year oldcement steps had green moss and black stains and I was able to clean they also. I used Scotts outdoor soap and can easily attach different nozzles and attachments. I hated our our gas power washer and we had much trouble with it. I hope this one lasts as it is a good value.;5.0;53;220
1045;Good price;I bought this article on sale and was a good deal it doesnt has a lot of power but works.;3.0;1045;220
1046;Excellent deal;I did purchase this pressure washer about a month ago and just used it. I am very happy with it. I got a lot of bang for my buck. I really like it.;5.0;1046;220
1047;Like the extras that came with it.;For its size works good. Have two gas ones but cant use inside due to fumes. This electric one does the job.;5.0;1047;220
1048;Works great;Great price works great;5.0;1048;220
1049;Easy to use;Does what I need it to do. Great attachments. Not as powerful as gas powered but knew that before purchase.;4.0;1049;220
1050;Nice machine;Nice machine . Its slower than a gas machine but it gets the job done.;4.0;727;220
1051;Great for every job around the house!;I have used the Black Max Pressure washer countless times since it arrived. I was able to clean green moss type mold from between the clay bricks in my courtyard that has been there for years. This piece of equipment is very easy to handle, even for a small person such as myself. I LOVE MY PRESSURE WASHER!!!!;5.0;1051;220
1052;Black Max Electric Pressure Washer;Had a gas pressure washer. Worked well for a couple of years, with some minor repairs, then finally went kaput. Only need it for light cleaning. This one started without problem, and did the job it was intended for. AND it was reasonably priced.;5.0;1052;220
1053;Save your money;Bought last year and used once. Not strong enough to do much more than wash your car. Sprayer is plastic and not rugged. Sprayer ailed on me this year. Internal components rusted even though the washer was drained. Threaded connection to the sprayer is plastic. Cheaply made. Now junkyard.;1.0;1053;220
1054;Diet Tonic Water;Schweppes makes a good Diet Tonic. I prefer Canada Dry only because it seems to hold the fizz longer. I dont drink generic, I have not found any of the off-brands that taste good compared to Schweppes and Canada Dry. Please dont stop carrying or even add Canada Dry. The only other thing I suggest is to stock more on the shelves as most of the time there is maybe one or two on the shelf. Sartell Walmart;4.0;1054;221
1055;Best tasting tonic water;If you drink tonic water, this one is the best tasting and it is great that Walmart now has it available and will ship it to your home. I hope they continue this!;5.0;1055;221
1056;very expensive for one bottle;the product advertise said 15pk, I have no idea what that means but I assumed it was going to be 15 pack - it turned out to be one bottle for 2.50 - less expensive to buy at the store! It does not make any sense.;1.0;1056;221

1061;Schweppes Diet Tonic water;It was just ok, I will buy it only if you guys run out of your Great Value Diet Tonic Water. (Because I have to have the diet) Schweppes just doesnt have the flavor nor does it it hold its carbonation like the Great Value Brand does.;3.0;1061;221

1065;Diet tonic Water;Great product and will purchase again.;;472;221
1066;Best tasting tonic water;If you drink tonic water, this one is the best tasting and it is great that Walmart now has it available and will ship it to your home. I hope they continue this!;;1055;221
1067;Diet Tonic Water;Schweppes makes a good Diet Tonic. I prefer Canada Dry only because it seems to hold the fizz longer. I dont drink generic, I have not found any of the off-brands that taste good compared to Schweppes and Canada Dry. Please dont stop carrying or even add Canada Dry. The only other thing I suggest is to stock more on the shelves as most of the time there is maybe one or two on the shelf. Sartell Walmart;;1054;221

1081;Skinny Margarita;My wife loves margaritas. And, I have always struggled with How to make the perfect Margarita. But, along comes Jose Cuervo Classic Lime Light Margarita Mix and l feel like a pro. With zero calories zero carbs and zero sugars, the only calories (sugars) are from the alcohol. This mix is the best. Heres my formula: - 2 parts mix - 1 part tequila (I love Logado from Total Wine) - 3 to 4 teaspoons of artificial sweetner - a big splash of Gran Gala Liquer (the drink should become a light amber color) - 1/2 fresh lime juice Mix well and add crushed ice.

1124;Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita;Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers Theyre enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.;5.0;1124;226
1125;Love it;Excellent flavor, not at all sweet/syrupy like other mixes;5.0;1125;226

1138;Amazing;This was out of stock almost everywhere and I nabbed the last one on Amazon. It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regans, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regans, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.;;1138;228
1139;Fantastic Bitters;I use these in all kinds of tiki drinks and they are really great - they have lots of warm spice notes and lend an exotic flavor to rum based drinks. I would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off, but Im a huge fan personally. Its tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond Angostura, so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails.;;1139;228
1140;Nice addition;These are an interesting addition to a bitters collection. Excellent in rum drinks. Very pleased and would definitely recommend if you mix up cocktails.;;1140;228

1196;Warm dark notes;The Burlesque has a distinctive central flavor - I think its walnut husk, aromatic and bitter in itself, and easy to pair with warm flavors. I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters Ive tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, its good. If I didnt make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: Im not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper.

1207;Good based on your tastes;Only knock is for the actual taste which is not quite orange cream but a vanilla-vinegar orange rhine sort of taste. Depends on what youre going for in taste profile as I can see this easily matching some others preferences for mixed drinks.;3.0;1207;228
1208;These bitters taste great and last a long time;These bitters taste great and last a long time. A perfect addition to a Manhattan or Old Fashioned! Product arrived in perfect condition and on time.;5.0;1208;228
1209;Beware the foul plastic dropper rod;Dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off. Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to ones drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermens Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, its disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material. Bittermens, you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod.;2.0;1209;228
1210;Warning: SHRUB VINEGAR;Just a friendly reminder: Shrub bitters are bitters that contain lots of vinegar. If the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you, then you may enjoy this. If it doesnt, then you do NOT want these. (Take a whiff and it smells like someone dying easter eggs.) (If you want a spicy bitter thats not a shrub, try Scrappys Habanero firewater bitters instead!);2.0;1210;228

1213;great product, smells heavenly;They smell fantastic. I havent tried them myself yet, but they smell like heaven and Ive been informed they taste good, too. Bottle is sturdy and doesnt leak. Dropper works well and doesnt drip much, so its easy to transfer to drink cleanly.;5.0;1213;228
1214;Hop and grapefruit flavors are nicely balance. Good for cocktails that would benefit from ...;Tasty stuff. Hop and grapefruit flavors are nicely balance. Good for cocktails that would benefit from some sharp, high flavor notes.;5.0;1214;228
1215;Orange Cream - meh;Ive tried this in a few drinks so far and none have turned out tasting any good.I wrote to the company and asked if they had any suggestions for using it but they never responded.Probably will just sit on the shelf now until I get tired of seeing it and toss it.;2.0;1215;228
1216;Fast Shipping, great product. Limited uses.;Ive had this for about 2 weeks now and I cant seem to find too many uses for it. Great in Gin martini type drinks and mellows out some harsher spirits in cocktails. Otherwise I cant really find too many recipes online or uses for it. Shipping and packaging is excellent.;4.0;1216;228
1217;Interesting - wish it had a little more heat.;I bought this for one specific purpose - as an ingredient for a cocktail called Carter Beats the Devil . . . and, it works great. Its not quite as prominent of an ingredient as the chili tincture that the restaurant in San Francisco used, but it does the job - just wish it had more punch per drop.Ive used it quite a bit - and, since it is measured in drops, itll probably last me forever.I am interested now in trying more of Bittermens bitters . . . glad I bought this one.;4.0;1217;228
1218;Delicious;I love all sorts of bitters, but this one is a favorite of mine, it has a complex flavor with hints of cardamom and clove and also exotic fruits. I like it in grapefruit, gin and sodas, and also in Jack and Cokes. Makes a great Manhattan!;5.0;1118;228
1219;The Best Bitters;Bittermens Xocolatl Mole Bitters add a complex note to Manhattans other cocktails- very full flavored, rich undertone. We love it.;5.0;1219;228
1220;Great;Perfect for the Carter Beats the Devil cocktail, an invention of Flora in Oakland. 20 drops go a very long way.;5.0;1220;228
1221;Amazing;The Tear Dropper is a bit confusing your first time, but these are simply delicious. The aroma hits you right off the bat when you open the bottle. The aromatic hops go wonderfully with grapefruit, and these bitters are awesome in a Sawyer, Mojito, or Daiquiri. It is a strange combination, but it really works. Try these!;5.0;1221;228
1222;Bitters expressly made for tequila!;My husband is a tequila officianado...and was delighted to find these bitters on amazon.com...he immediately ordered them and enjoys a drop in his tequila on the rocks every evening...great product!;5.0;1222;228

1225;Tasty;On the advice of a highly knowledgeable relative, I bought this as a stocking stuffer for another family member. It was a big hit, and I must say, very interesting addition to a cocktail. Now I need some.;5.0;1225;228

1234;Not too spicy it is just perfect. Experiment to fit your taste;Interesting flavor to add to summer refreshments. Not too spicy it is just perfect. Experiment to fit your taste.;5.0;1234;228
1235;Best chocolate bitters Ive found;I love chocolate bitters in a Manhattan. The full flavor of these bitters balances nicely with the richness of Carpano Antica--not everything does and you need a Rye with some kick to bring it all together.;5.0;1235;228
1236;Excellent cocktail flavoring;This stuff has just the right amount of heat - enough to be worth using, but not so much that you can make your cocktails undrinkable without effort. I put it in any cocktail that needs a little bite, and have been happy with the results.;5.0;885;228
1237;The Perfect Bitters;Not wanting alcohol on an outing with colleagues but wanting something that has taste, I ordered club soda with bitters. It was a well sorted bar, and the bar tender gave me the choice. Loving anything spicy, I tried the Hellfire and it was so wonderful that I had to order a bottle to greet me when I get home.;5.0;1237;228
1238;Two drops;Two drops in a gin vermouth martini is just about perfect. Good stuff. Luckily, it comes with a dropper...;5.0;1238;228
1239;Delicious;Ive put it in my Manhattans and martinis. Super delicious! I cant wait to try it in other drinks. Ive used 4 drops per drink for a little kick on the back end.;5.0;1239;228
1240;Not as hot as I wanted.;This doesnt put out the heat I wanted. To get a good bite you add so much it effects the flavor of the drink.Its not terrible. But a chopped jalapeo can get just as much if not more heat , with a better flavor.;3.0;1240;228
1241;Bright (not bitter) celery flavor for drinks!;While Bittermens primarily makes various kinds of bitters for making drinks -- this one is not technically bitters, but a tart shrub -- especially good for adding to Bloody Marys, and an amazing Bloody Shrimp Martini. Im sure you could make a good drink in the traditional shrub recipes -- but a dropper of this really brightens up even the most plain-jane Bloody recipe with a shot of liquid celery flavor. Love it!;5.0;1241;228
1242;Nice addition;These are an interesting addition to a bitters collection. Excellent in rum drinks. Very pleased and would definitely recommend if you mix up cocktails.;5.0;1242;228
1243;Adds a nice flavor note to my mai tai;which I make, and enjoy, and I am totally not an alcoholic just because I have an adult beverage once or twice a week. With some bitters in it.;4.0;1243;228
1244;One of my favorite bitters!;Mixology has become a passion of mine--Im known in my friend circle for making GFCs (Good Fn Cocktails!). Bittermens Hellfire is one of my secret ingredients. It adds just the right subtle heat to anything I make.Ive carefully selected over a dozen really top-notch hand-crafted bitters to add just the right extra something to my cocktails. These folks have created one of the very best bitters out there. (Thank you!);5.0;1244;228
1245;Great!;adds great flavor to any beverage. I suggest trying it with vodka or gin. Looking forward to using it in a drink with dark liqueur.;5.0;1245;228
1246;Amazing stuff;So the Habanero Bitters are great in a version of a Margarita we do that traditionally used tabasco. I like this at least as much and you dont get any of the vinegar flavor one does from Tabasco.Also, LOVE the tiki bitters and a bitter monk is my new favorite cocktail just because I get to use this in it.Great stuff.;5.0;1246;228
1247;Just wish it hadnt spilled in shipping;These bitters are great and the dropper bottle is an easy way to use th estuff in all kinds of cocktails. My only complaint was that the Boston Bitahs leaked in transit, so the entire box smelled (great) and I only have about 25 of the bottle remaining. Still, that was one bottle out of an order of 12 so Im not complaining.;4.0;1246;228
1248;Fantastic Bitters;I use these in all kinds of tiki drinks and they are really great - they have lots of warm spice notes and lend an exotic flavor to rum based drinks. I would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off, but Im a huge fan personally. Its tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond Angostura, so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails.;5.0;1248;228
1249;Goes a long way!;I was at the Kentucky bourbon mixology competition recently and all the bartenders were making spicy flavored drinks. I looked all around for this stuff and finely ordered it here.My first cocktail was great:2 oz. Rye Whiskey (or bourbon)0.5 oz. Simple Syrup1 Lemon Twist2 Dashes of Peychauds Bitters30 Drops of Bittermens Habanero Bitters (Start with 20 and increase from there, it gets hot!)Serve it on ice;5.0;1249;228
1250;Amazing;This was out of stock almost everywhere and I nabbed the last one on Amazon. It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regans, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regans, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.;5.0;1250;228
1251;Not your grandfathers Bitters;This will spice up your average cocktail and turn it into a signature cocktail. I bet youll enjoy it too!;4.0;1251;228
1252;For some burn in your booze;Subtle and slow building.Great with Citrus and flavorful bases, like anejo tequila, gin, or golden rum.Bittermens makes some of the most unique bitters.;5.0;1252;228
1253;Delicious in a Mojito;I mentioned to the bar tender that the secret ingredient in a Mojito was a couple of drops of bitters. He did not have the Angostura bitters so we tried the Bittermens Hopped Grapefruit Bitters. All I can say is Ay, caramba!The bitters gave the Mojito a very refreshing taste!;5.0;1253;228
1254;Exquisite taste sensation!;This flavor of bitters is quite unique! There is a subtle warmth and profound chocolate flavor that is haunting. We like it in a tequila-based coffee liqueur. Add half a shot of good scotch and you have a drink worthy of the finest company you know...;5.0;885;228
1255;Bitters complimentary to Tropical drinks;For any Tikiphile out there, these are a great addition to any tropical drink recipes. I substitute them in place of Angostura bitters in Zombies, Rum Barrels and 151 Swizzles. They may be a bit niche in their application, but its a wonderful product nonetheless.;5.0;1255;228
1256;Margaritaville margarita mix;One of the best tasting mix!;4.0;1256;229

1299;Great stuff!;I am a whiskey sour lover, but imbibing only when out to dinner. Hubby suggested trying home. I was so happy to find this product my Walmart Supercenter! First, its taste is great. Not much difference in taste from Mr. and Mrs. Ts, which is slightly higher in price. Prior to purchasing Walmart, wasnt aware they carried mixers - foolish on my part - duh, they have everything! I was paying like 4.50 to 5.00 per bottle other stores. At Walmart, believe it or not, it is...........2.88!!!!!!! So I stocked up bought 3 bottles. They also have it in a lite version......sugar-free and I thought that would be great......not so. I drink suger-free pop, but this doesnt taste as good in the sugar-free version. So tomorrow I am going to exchange 2 of the bottles for the regular type. Hey, a few carbs here and there.....oh well! Love Walmart!

1327;Pure agave splendor without needless wood byproducts;Lets face it, distilled alcohol products arent health foods. But clear liquor products (vodka, gin, white rum, and silver tequila) contain less toxic wood solute byproducts (tannins and formaldehydes) than heavily-aged dark liquors. Science aside, Sauza Signature Silver is a splendid treat and delightful to sip. The clean, crisp agave taste that makes tequila so special is front-and-center without the woody heaviness of darker tequilas. Tequila is an acquired taste, and Sauza Signature Blue is a taste worth acquiring...a taste to be savored.;5.0;1327;236

1358;Way tooooo Sweet;I usually make my own cosmos, but thought is would be quicker to use a mix. Bad Idea. This particular flavor was soooo sweet. I had to keep adding lime to it to temper the sicky-sweetness. If you like sweet then this is for you. Does not taste like a true cosmo with their recipe.;2.0;1358;246

1363;The Best;This is, BY FAR, the best tasting Mango Margarita Mix on the market. Perfect for on the rocks. All other brands are thick......almost like a puree, which is not good for a margarita on the rocks. That stuff is more for frozen daiquiris. This is the same consistency as any regular margarita mix. Perfect.;5.0;1363;248

1434;Dont waste your calories;Actually, the Great Value crescent rolls in my areas Walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing ... plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls. Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now Im extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.;1.0;1434;256
1435;Horrible!;If I could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating, I would! I would even give it a negative star. Of course, whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can, you expect a POP! Well, nothing happenedat first. I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase. From now on, I know to go with a more reputable brand.;1.0;1435;256
1436;These have to be opened and rolled cold.;I bought three of these for the first time to make a new breakfast casserole. One package was opened right after taking them out of the fridge and was the bottom of the casserole. The second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole. It was useless and had to be thrown away. It was a ball of sticky, gooey, unshapable dough. Into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand. We had one pack left that I just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand. My little ones even had seconds. I think that the fact that they were still really cold when I opened the package and put them on the cookie sheet really helped.;4.0;1436;256
1437;Great Value Great Product - Works as expected.;This is a good product and it works as expected. I am not sure why so many reviews are there criticizing it. You are buying a dough and you got to mold it as you need.. not sure being flaky and all is a valid critic for this product... it holds shape as it should and bakes nicely...It tastes good and nice... This worked just as planned and I was able to make rolls as planned..!!!! Will recommend !!! Thank you walmart !!!;5.0;1437;256
1438;Very difficult to use;First off, I could not get the package open. Then, when I opened it, there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents. I had to break off bits of dough, roll them in my hands, and make drop biscuits. Terrible!;2.0;1438;256
1439;Impossible to make crescent rolls with;These were terrible!!! It seems like they are just crammed into the packaging. There is no way to roll them out into triangles. It just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them. I ended up having to roll it all out and make my own! Too much work! Next time I will be spending the extra 0.30 or so and going with Pillsbury!! Heck, Id even pay 5.00 more to not deal with this garbage!;1.0;1439;256
1440;Absolutely useless;First, lets establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents. Hence crescent rolls. These are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls. The dough stuck together would not unroll. Where I needed triangles, I came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough. It was 100 useless for the recipe I was making. I was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these.;1.0;1440;256
1441;Great Value Crescent Rolls;The dough looked like it was crammed into the packaging. I could not use it without combining the dough to roll out and cut wedges myself. Then they came out hard and very small. It mustve been at the end of the line and what was left over. This has happened more than once, will not purchase again. The savings is not worth it.;1.0;1441;256
1442;good eating;Crescent rolls are something of an extra for us. We dont buy them real often because of the price but, Great Value crescents are so good and the price is reasonable that we dont have of splurge. I make rolls, use them for crusts, roll apple slices in them and slice them in long strips and sugar and cinnamon them. Just twist them and you hace a great and fast snack. Good eating.;5.0;1442;256
1443;Poor choice for not much savings;These rolls were much smaller than Pillsburys and much harder to get out of the can. They ripped and shredded making them just about worthless. I will not purchase again.;1.0;1443;256
1444;crescent pieces;The crescent rolls taste good , but the last couple of times i purchased them they were so smashed together i had to build crescent rolls out of the pieces that i could separate.;3.0;1444;256

1457;Kit was delivered in 2 days and in great shape. Expiration date was July 2016;Kit was delivered in 2 days and in great shape. Expiration date was July 2016. I started the kit 2 days ago and added one cup of medium toast american oak, half a can of frozen concentrate grape juice, and some blanched raisins with dates. I added water to 5.25 gallons and got a specific gravity of 1.095. It smells great, and fermentation is in high gear. I expect I will rack twice (week 2 6) and bulk age for several months before bottling. I am quite satisfied so far. Thanks to ABC Cork Co. and Amazon for this wonderful kit.;;1457;258

1461;Very good low cost wine kit!;I have made over 60 wine kits over the last 4 years. This kit performed as well as any of the other kits. I bought the Merlot Fontana Wine kit and added about a cup of oak chips and about 3/4 cup dried elderberries which I do with all my Merlots. At 4 weeks I stabilized and put in the clarifiers. As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor. I expect to bottle and age this for no less than 6 months, at which time I believe it will be a very good tasting wine. Thanks to Fontana and Amazon for supplying us with a low cost, good tasting wine kit. Hoping they add more varietals at this price in the near future.;;1461;258

1463;Delicious Summer Mai tai Coctail Mix;I was so happy to have located Mr Mrs T Mai Tai Mix at Wallmart on-line. It is nearly impossible to find it in NJ (grocery or liquor stores). Usually, I am not a fan of any bar drink mixes, particularly now sugary ones, but this one is a fabulous concoction! Not too sweet, the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour, with a touch of bitter almonds. Just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing Baccardi Rum garnish with Maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple (on a skewer). I have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer :) Had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors. We are hooked! Wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable SH charge. It arrived in good condition (product is shelf stable). Ill be ordering it again next season, or maybe earlier if we want to have a nice summer cocktail in the winter months!;5.0;1463;259
1464;Good for a premixed drink;I like to add a shot of light rum and a shot of spiced rum. Its a little sweeter than I would prefer but not bad at all for a premixed drink. It has been a hit at our pool parties.;4.0;1464;259
1465;Best Mai Tai mix;Ive tried a number of different Mai Tai mixes and this is the best one by far. But it can be hard to find in stores. Im glad I found it online so that I no longer have to worry about finding someplace that carries it. For my perfect Mai Tai, I use a combination of Trader Vics dark and spiced rums, this mai tai mix, and a splash of orange juice.;5.0;1465;259
1466;I like this one better.;I could no longer fine my usual brand, even on the company website so I started looking for a new Mai Tai mixer. Look it up, these are complicated to make from scratch. I kept seeing this brand so I decided to order it and was very pleasantly surprized. This mix is a little more pineapple than the last, but I like that.;5.0;1466;259

1471;Fairly good value, okay selection.;I grew up loving Shasta, but I can never find their best flavors. It comes with lemon-lime, orange, grape, and fruit punch. My favorite is the punch and, in my opinion, the lemon-lime is better than most lemon-lime sodas. The grape and orange are just okay. It is nothing special, but it is a pretty good value. Also nice to have a variety of sodas handy on hot summer days, especially when having guests over.;4.0;1471;262
1472;Love the variety!;We purchased these for an event at school and they were a big hit. Everyone loved the variety! It is nice to have something other than the big name, brown sodas. I remember Shasta from when I was a kid and it is still good. Great value for the money!;5.0;1472;262

1501;Great Product, excellent taste!;I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.;5.0;1501;266

1507;Looks Works Great;Ive only had it for a few weeks but it looks better than the photos, and it works great. Its a perfect size (18 bottles) for a countertop, and cant be heard. If something changes I will update my review, but so far, it exceeds expectations. I would also note that I only use it for reds and the temperature doesnt fluctuate. Got my moneys worth on this product.;;1507;270
1508;One Star;Will not cool down. Returning!;;1508;270
1509;Greattt BUT;It looks great. A real attention piece in our kitchen. Tons of space. I removed the lower rack and have some sodas, other various drinks from time to time.... my only and bigest issue with this is that I can never get the temperature down past 51. If thats okay for you, this is a great cooler. My wife likes her wine cold and in an ideal situation temp would be 41-44 degrees. This is not capable of that no matter how long you leave it on. One more thing, everytime you open the door even if its for a matter of seconds you will see a temperature rise of about 3 degrees. Foolishness. Great for the price but thats it.;;1509;270
1510;Worth the low price.;Didnt have any reviews when I bought it so I just paid the extra cash for the Assurion insurance. I really like this thing. Sleep and stylish looks really good in my living room for my expensive beer collection that I wanted to cellar. I dont think you can cellar anything where I live in SoCal so this helped out a lot. On the lower levels of the temp range the fan is pretty loud. If you can handle that then you will be OK.;;1510;270
1511;Two Stars;Never gets cold enough.;;1511;270
1512;So far so good;We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, wont have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so dont put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we wont have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.;;1512;270
1513;Love this Wine Cellar;Excellent Wine Cellar, doesnt take up much space. Its quiet when running and seems to maintain the temperature you set it. This is only the case if you dont have a power outage in your area. It will default to 66 degrees when the power returns.;;1513;270

1515;otherwise it seems to be working pretty well.;Didnt get 5 stars because it doesnt spare any room for bottles that are a little longer. They should redesign for a little extra room, otherwise it seems to be working pretty well.;;1515;270
1516;very happy so far;We received this two days ago in perfect condition. so far I am very satisfied. The unit looks great, operates fairly quietly, and is maintaining a perfect 55 degrees for our good reds. i only have 55 bottles in it so I have not tested the full capacity. the only con so far is that we have a few fatter than normal bottles that did not fit on certain shelves and some taller bottles that did not fit on the bottom shelves because of the compressor behind. But these are minor annoyances.;;1516;270
1517;Met expectations;Slightly noisier than Id prefer but quiet enough to have just outside a bedroom. Bottles fit nicely. The unit doesnt take up too much space but holds good amount. Overall pleased after 2 months of use.;;1517;270

1546;Easy Hydrometer Readings;This product works exactly as expected. Makes taking samples for hydrometer readings easier than ever. I just drop my hydrometer into the thief and get my reading with no other equipment needed.The only problem I have is sometimes it doesnt drain very well when I have lots of hop particles or other solids floating around in the wort, but this is more of just a small annoyance than any kind of defect in the product.;;1546;272

Besides using a refractometer, it would be nice if these wine thiefs and hydrometers were smaller in diameter so as to not waste so much beer when taking gravity samples.;;1549;272
1550;If you test your home brew with a hydrometer, this is a must!;Great way to safely and easily remove some home brew from a 5 gallon batch to test it with a hydrometer. Gives you a good long reach into the carboy and it does a great job grabbing enough for testing purposes. Using mine with a 5 gallon glass carboy with a top that accommodates a size 7 stopper. Sanitize it beforehand to prevent contamination and if youre careful you can pour it back when youre done. Dripping is truly minimal. Might find a drop or two from point A to B. Not a necessity for every home brewer but for me its come in handy.;;1550;272

I add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop. Right now I am using it with an orange chicken stir fry. My problem is that I have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the Walmart stores where I bought it originally. While this is a great product I really dont want to buy a case of it. However, if that is the only way I can get it I may have no other choice. Please start stocking this in the stores.;5.0;1565;277
1566;This makes a great syrup for pancakes and waffles!;I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I dont drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldnt work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldnt even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. Its not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I cant find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy. Its the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled.;5.0;1566;277
1567;This has hit bottom--used to be great;Until recently (Spring 2012)Mr MRS Ts Original tasted like a tomato juice based scrumptous blody-mary mix. My wife and I enjoyed it. Now the original is made with high fructose cord syrup and no loger even tastes like it has a tomato juice base. I will no longer purchase this bastardized concoction.;;1567;278
1568;Very good alone!;I actually like this alone, without any vodka! Tomato juice is good, but I love the spiciness of this mix even better. The cans make it portable (I carry them as a snack at work), and although Im disappointed that Mr. Mrs. T has apparently discontinued the 11.5 oz size I used to buy, this size works for me, too.;;1568;278
1569;Great taste and reasonable size;I keep these on hand for my aging mother in assisted living as she likes a little spice in her snacks. These taste very good and are small enough for a quick snack between meals. I also use them in soups and stews to enrich the broth. They even make a great quick cup of soup by themselves when microwaved and topped with some grated cheese. Very nice product.;;1569;278
1570;Better than the bottle;I developed an appreciation for this drink during my days of frequent airline travel. I prefer to drink them straight (without booze). As a result, I started buying bottles of the mix at the grocery store--because finding this by the can in the real world is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, when you buy this by the bottle something happens. The first glass tastes exactly as you expected. But once you open the bottle, if you dont drink the contents within 24-36 hours the taste turns. Keeping a stock of cans in the house, therefore, is essential. I live in a major metropolitan area and I cant find these cans in any store. Not grocery stores (including mom pop, big chains, high-end small chains, etc), not liquor stores (including corner stores or BevMo). Enter Amazon. Im very grateful I can buy this by the can here on the interwebs. I personally prefer the smaller-size cans to the 11.5 ounce. Make sure to buy enough to qualify for super saver shipping.;;1570;278
1571;One of the best Bloody Mary Mixes, though one of the most common;I think you can probably get this at most grocery stores. It really is one of the best mixes for bloody marys. You hardly have to add anything extra to make a reasonable bloody mary. I usually add olives and pickle juice, though.;;1571;278
1572;I used to get these on AA flights with my snack back in the day!;These beverages are good with or without Alcohol. They used to hand them out like candy on American Airlines. I saw them here on Amazon and I could not resist!;;1572;278
1573;This stuff is Great!!!;From the amount of this stuff I order, the folks at Amazon must think Im a serious alcoholic. Truth is, I drink this because its an extremely tasty Tomato Juice Cocktail! No alcohol necessary. Much tastier than V-8. Try it! You could even add alcohol, if it pleases you.;;1573;278
1574;Very Good Bloody Mary Mix - Highly Recommended!;Mr Mrs Ts Bloody Mary Mix is our favorite off-the-shelf Bloody Mary mix and these 5.5oz cans are very convenient. We use the less expensive larger bottles if we know our guests will be having Bloody Marys but like these cans for single servings since the larger bottles need to be refrigerated after being opened.We add a little more than 1oz of Vodka (your taste may vary) and find that it really doesnt need anything else for most people. It is just spicy enough for my wife, but I put an extra shot of Tabasco Sauce in mine and my mother cuts hers with a little tomato juice to dilute the heat a little. These are also good straight (without any spirits added) and as substitute for tomato juice in cooking (particularly vegetable stock) to add an extra zing to your dishes.The 24 can case is a good value (especially if you have Prime or qualify for free Super Saver shipping) since we could only find them in smaller packs locally and at a much higher price per can.Highly Recommended!CFH;;1574;278
1575;Aromatic;To compare with other orange bitters: these are more aromatic-tasting and have more of a real orange zest flavor than Fees orange, which are more of a candy orange flavor, though they differ from Angostura orange, which taste more like Angostura aromatic bitters mixed with Fees orange bitters. This is not to say that it is better different cocktails work better with the other two. I find that a dash of these ones turns an otherwise decent sidecar into an incredible one.;;1575;279
1576;better bitters;Regans Orange Bitters No.6 is not only a wonderful flavor for mixed drinks but makes water, yep plain ol water, taste fabulous!Purchased 3 bottles knowing that at least 2 of them will make wonderful stocking stuffers.;;1576;279
1577;Best Orange Bitter;Ive tried 5 other orange bitters, and I like this one the best. Not too sweet or citrus intensive (like Angostura). A little bit of a spice like flavor to compliment the orange. Works perfect in my Cherry Manhattan -- 3 parts Wild Turkey Rye, 1 part Herring Cherry liqueur, 2 dashes of Regans, 2 Merry Maraschino cherries and a spoon of cherry juice from the cherry jar. So goooooood!;;1577;279
1578;My favorite orange bitters;In my opinion, this is the best all around orange bitters on the market. It has a very bitter, but complex flavor profile. For a lighter, more citrusy orange bitters, try Fee brothers west indian. But Regans adds more depth to most (though not all) cocktails.;;1578;279
1579;Going through a bitters period.;Regans Orange Bitters 6 is just as advertised. Intense and very potent, it will give your Manhattan or Old Fashioned a real kick in the pants. I want to experiment using it with Crepes Suzette or Grand Marnier cakes - it should intensify and enhance quite well. In addition: If you have not tried Fee Brothers Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters or Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - then you have not experienced what bitters can do for your cocktails - or vanilla ice cream - for that matter! I am afraid that the old stand-by Angostura just doesnt compare - and I like Angostura very much!;;1579;279
1580;The best bitters Ive found;These orange bitters are very flavorful and, unlike several other brands, are not overly sweet. They are excellent in any of the dryer liquors. I always seek this product out over others of this type.;;1580;279
1581;Best orange bitters on the market;Well balanced, aromatic, just spicy enough without being overpowering. Highly recommended for your next manhattan, and a lovely stocking stuffer.;;1581;279
1582;Your Secret Ingredient;Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail. Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails. After doing extensive research I learned that Regans made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product). Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regans however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you dont get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you wont be disappointed. Go to Regans website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters. Youll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini.;;1582;279
1583;Not ready for prime time;I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrichs book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regans orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regans. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.;;1583;280
1584;An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name;I think its fair to say that Angosturas ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged. And with the release of Angosturas orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch. I am a huge fan of Regans orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angosturas offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange. Brilliant. I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesnt;;1584;280
1585;A Dash of Brilliance from Angostura;Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor! I havent yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold.;;1585;280
1586;Nice product but price a head scratcher;Angostura Orange Bitters is now the third product in a tiny little product niche that includes long-standing stalwart Fee Brothers and Regans No. 6. Since the traditional Angostura Bitters (essential ingredient in Manhattan and Pegu Club cocktails) is an institution that has extremely wide distribution, this product is piggybacking off the older products brand recognition and iconic status. So why does this product cost 9.95 for 4 oz. when Regans No. 6 costs 6.26 for 5 oz. and Fee Brothers costs 6.99 for 5 oz. The answer is that price probably doesnt matter if youve got the distribution. How many bottles of orange bitters you gonna go through this year, BippyBuy Amazons 3-pack with one bottle of each brand, and youll be set -- and confused -- for life.Angostura Orange Bitters happen to be very good.;;1586;280
1587;Wheat Beers Best Friend;a single drop in the glass before you pour a wheat beer (belgian style) does the job much better than a slice of orange. the flavor hit is pure aromatic orange without the nasty taste of the pith.failed experiments included:*more than one drop: over the top*in a glass of budmillcoor lite: weirdly bitter and flavorless at the same time*in a trappist ale: puts the beer out of balanceLynn Hoffman, author The Short Course in Beer;;1587;280
1588;GREAT Quality at a GREAT price;Bitters have been so strong in the craft-cocktail scene these days, and we are always searching for the best quality and flavors to put behind our bar. This version of Angostura Bitters (Orange) contributes a wonderfully tart and sweet hint to any drink. We are incredibly happy with the results that have been shown when using these. The Price point on this bottle wins all the starts however, as our wholesale purveyors carry the same product for about 5 higher than Amazons list-price.;;1588;280

1593;Great collins mix;Cant find it anywhere in stores and the price is unbelievable check some of the prices people are asking. just move to Maryland from Virginia all VA stores always had it on their shelves, I think its as close to hand made as you can find. I will always have some on hand as long as I can find it.;5.0;1593;284
1594;To sweet;It took me 3 orders to get the right product. The Collins mix was to sweet for my taste. I tried diluting the mix to cut down on the sweetness but to no avail. I found a product called Polar Tom Collins mix which was almost perfect and can be purchased on-line for a much lower price.;2.0;1594;284

1599;Five Stars;A great buy for the home bottler. Would recommend to a brewing friend.;;1599;285
1600;Four Stars;Look good, just your basic old bottle caps.;;1600;285
1601;Four Stars;Seems like they should go on the bottle better;;541;285
1602;They are great for charms but you should know a couple of things;I purchased these to make charms. They work fine, but if you are using them for this purpose you should know they have a plastic liner. I didnt see that in the description and didnt think about it till thy were received. You can peel off the liner but its a nuisance. Also, I use a Sizzix Big Kick to flatten. At first they were going complete flat and distorted into ovals. After several frustrating attempts, I realized I was using an extra shim from a previous project. If you use just the base plate and the 2 cutting plates, they will turn out perfectly. Also, they cut deep and will stick to the cutting plate but will pop out very easily. My plates are already pretty shot, so I will probably keep using them just for the bottle caps and get new ones for my other projects.;;1602;285
1603;Love this product!;This is the best Bloody Mary mix Ive ever tried! The balance of spice is excellent and when I add the amount of Vodka called for in the recipe it makes a very tasty ( and not too strong ) drink. My order arrived on the day I was told it would, was well packaged and in perfect condition. Very good value for the price! I will order again!;5.0;1603;286
1604;good for what it is intend for...;good for pina coladas. no complains.;4.0;1604;287
1605;Yucky!;This mix is overly sweet and probably could lose the high fructose corn syrup. It also has a soapy taste often associated with coconut oil. I will be dumping it out!;1.0;1605;287
1606;im happy with product;ive only used a few yeasts in my day for making wine, cider, and mead and ive never found much difference in taste depending on yeast. i started my latest hooch two days ago and id like to say ive never had a more active batch. in a 1 gallon carboy or in my 5gal bucket the airlocks are going nuts, very active little buggers they are.;;1606;288
1607;Love this yeast!;I use it for apfelwein (google edworts apfelwein for the recipe). The standard for apfelwein is montrachet, but I find that the cote des blancs ferments out a little dryer, while leaving a cleaner overall flavor and a bit of lingering sweet sensation on your tongue. Costs 1/pack at my local homebrew store, and stays good in the fridge for a couple years, so no point in not buying in bulk.;;1607;288
1608;Highly recommend!!;I love this it has become my go to for white, and blush brews. There is virtually no foam at all, just a little bubbling. I used this with pear, the final product was so wonderfully aromatic, and the taste was superb. It made you just want to drink glass after glass of it. There was a nice level of alcohol as well, about 9-10. However, I made 6 gallons and only used one package. The instructions say one package will do up to 5 gallons so if I had used two I would probably have gotten a higher alcohol percentage. Nevertheless, even with one package it was wonderful.;;1608;288
1609;Great Service!;I like this product because it makes the homemade wine smell with fruity aromas. Great product for red or white wines, but works well with 100 apple juice.;;1609;288
1610;A little slow, but very effective for many white wines.;I used this to make apple wine and it was marvelous. It worked very well and didnt have a yeasty flavor at all. It can be a little slow to start, but that is likely because I wasnt using it for the intended purpose. If youre looking for a long-lasting, simple, affordable yeast for white wines of any type, this will keep you happy.It is worth noting that each packet is enough for 5 gallons worth of wine so long as you give it sufficient time to ferment.;;1610;288
1611;yeast;A wonderful yeast for making delicious and strong hard cider. Feed your yeast good, use raw sugar. Add yeast at room temp.;;1611;288
1612;Perfect for your lighter wines, ciders;Nice fresh yeast. This brand has always performed exceptionally, and we have never had a dud. It doesnt impart harsh yeasty flavors to your fermentables. We have used this for wine and mead, holds up to higher alcohol, we dont even prime it, we just pitch and the airlocks are bubbling merrily away in a few hours.;;1612;288
1613;good;Arrived in a timely manner and in good condition. Made honey mead over the fall. Works as directed. Will see results in the spring.;;1613;288
1614;Great Service;I like this product because it makes the homemade wine smell with fruity aromas. Great product for red or white wines, but works well with 100 apple juice.;;1609;288
1615;Good;Doesnt seem to go as dry as some yeasts. I had good results making apple cider in a 5 gallon bucket with this stuff. Would buy again.;;1615;288
1616;yeast;A wonderful yeast for making delicious and strong hard cider. Feed your yeast good, use raw sugar. Add yeast at room temp.;;1616;288
1617;Worked well;A standby, it worked well--still waiting on the finished product. I have used several packets and it is fairly bomb proof.;;1617;288
1618;Failed;Attempted twice to get this to make wine and it failed. It did not ferment at all. Perhaps it was a bad batch of yeast. ();;1618;288
1619;Highly recommend;I love this it has become my go to for white, and blush brews. There is virtually no foam at all, just a little bubbling.

1620;Mildly spicy mustard;This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. Ive tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood Im in and what Im putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesnt have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug. As a home brewer Ive often thought it would be nice to have a mug like this when I wanted to sample my beer.;;703;289
1621;Great German mustard;This is my favorite German mustard! It goes well with everything. The only reason it is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the price. The exact same product can be purchased at World Market for nearly half the price.;;700;289
1622;Nothing special;I am glad if people like this mustard - I am from Germany and this is one of the cheapest mustards and really not that good - in Germany it costs about one Euro or less, it is a cheap mustard.... dont buy it for the glass, its really small and cheap, this mustard is some generic brand, not from one of the good old German famous German companies (Kuehne, Thomy etc.).;;1622;289
1623;One of the best;I currently have nine different mustards in my house. I have lost count of how many I have tried over the years. Some will be bought again. This is one that will definitely always be in my house in the future.;;1623;289
1624;Good mustard, but overpriced!;I purchased this mustard based on the reviews. I am not disappointed in the taste however, I am in the packaging and the price. First, the tape used to hold the lid down was not as pictured nor was it very secure. The date code on the side of the lid is worn off where I cannot read the month or day...only the year, which is 2013. The price at 8.49 is about 5-6 too high. I have found it at MyBrands, which is the importers site for public sale, at 2.25 and elsewhere for 3 and up. I think the 8.49 price has the free shipping built in. I will be ordering this mustard again, but not through Atlantic Quality here on Amazon. Otherwise, very good mustard.;;1624;289
1625;Dusseldorf Mustard;This mustard is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! The only thing I wish you could sell it in big containers. The mug is great for at home, but I would like to use this mustard for other occasions where I would need to purchase it in a gallon container.( I hope it becomes available).I have tried alot of brands of Dusseldorf Mustard and this is by far the BEST yet!!!!!;;1625;289
1626;Best Mustard;Not too strong, not too weak without the overly eggy taste of others.Im a mustard lover. I used to keep 8-12 mustards on hand for different foods. If I had to pick one mustard for everything, this would be it. It will replace at least half my mustard collection.;;1626;289
1627;Awesome Mustard is Right!;I decided to buy this mustard for the novelty of the jar but WOW this is REALLY is good stuff. It has a creamy spicy mustardness I havent experienced before. And, this vendor shipped lightning fast and sent it packaged really well. A+++;;1627;289

2306;Hygienic, not glossy;If you wash your hands before putting this on, you dont have to worry about it a tube getting contaminated with a possible virus. You can even share it with friends! I also like that it isnt too glossy. The cooling sensation is nice too.;5.0;2306;290
2307;Does The Job!;I bought Carmex when I had a really bad case of chapped lips last winter after being out in the snow with my kids. A friend suggested that it would be the best remedy. It worked fast on my lips and it didnt leave an odd taste in my mouth.;5.0;2307;290
2308;Always Protects!;I have been using this for awhile now. I suffer from cold sores and so many of the other products just dry your lips. I have found as long as I catch the cold sore soon enough Carmex works just as well as the much more expensive brands.;5.0;2308;290
2309;Carmen is awesome!;I keep this product on hand year round.it works wonders for dry cracked lips. Once cooler weather hits, I make sure I have one carmex in my purse, once in my car and one at my desk. It is my go to product and makes my lips feel amazing.;5.0;2309;290
2310;my mama;when was a kid my mama would put carmex on lips then when she went to sleep i would roll the jar around the house carmex has been i part of life for 30 years and use it for my kids my 3 year old tries to eat it but now know how to use it;5.0;2310;290
2311;Sometimes you cant beat going with the original..;I have been religiously used the original lip balm jar since I was seventeen and now Im forty-one. I love it because of the fragrance and the silky feel. The taste is good too. I cant imagine replacing my carmex with anything else!!!!;5.0;2311;290
2312;The only TRUE healing lip balm;I have tried other enticing lip balms over the years but they never live up to Carmex Lip Balm Jar. I always come back to this for the same reasons...It works, it moistens my lips for a much longer period of time than other competitors.;5.0;2312;290
2313;Never leave home without one!;I have been wearing Carmex since I was a child. I am 34 now and still apply it almost everyday. recently I was on mediation that really dried out my lips and Carmex was the only thing that worked. LOVE IT. A must in my makeup bag/purse.;5.0;2313;290
2314;Always on hand;We always purchase Carmex Lip Balm in the jar. It is usually hard to find so when we do find it we empty the shelf to have it on hand. Winters can be harsh in Pennsylvania so we do not want to run out it keeps you lips soft year round;5.0;2314;290
2315;chapped;my son Cody always got chapped around the outside of his mouth ,in the winter time and his cheeks.We would put carmex on it,ad within a day it would heal it up and it would be gone.we love this stuff,it seems to work on almost everything.;5.0;2315;290
2316;20 years and still going!;I have been using Carmax for at least 20 years or more! I use nothing else for my lips but Carmax. Due to cold sores since I was 14, no other products work. No lipsticks, It is a everyday thing for me no exaggerating that is the truth!;5.0;2316;290
2317;Perfect overnight balm - never fails;I keep this on my nightstand and use it as part of my night time moisturizing. I love the way my lips feel in the morning. I forgot it on vacation once and could tell a huge difference. I love how lightweight but effective it is.;5.0;2317;290
2318;Carmex - Not just for the chapped lips!;Everyone in our house uses Carmex for chapped lips but thats not the only use! My husband has found it to be most helpful for the cracked skin around his fingernails. It provides relief from pain and helps to heal these sore spots, too.;5.0;2318;290
2319;Great lip balm;This was the first Carmex product I tried. I remember putting it every night before going to bed and waking in the morning with my lips feeling rejuvenated and fresh. I also used it during the day to protect my lips from the sun.;5.0;2319;290
2320;Love, love, love the original jar!;I use this on my lips all year long for soft kissable lips! I also use it on my upper lip and outside my nose when I have a cold. I put it on at night and when I wake up in the morning you would never know my skin was sore or chapped!;5.0;2320;290
2321;Soft Silky Lips;I purchase about 5 Carmex Lip Balms per month I enjoy the silky smooth texture it gives my lips. I love the feel and so does my husband. I make sure I always have a jar in my purse, car, work, every where. I really enjoy your product.;5.0;2321;290
2322;Still the best container!;Ive tried lip balm in sticks and tubes, but the Carmex jar is still the best container. Maybe its just habit but the unscrew and finger dip applies the protection and revitalization of Carmex more satisfactorily than any other method.;4.0;2322;290
2323;My Tried True Lip Care;I have used the original Carmex Lip Balm Jar for as long as I can remember. Its my go-to for lip care. Living at high altitude means dry air and chapped lips, so I keep Carmex handy at all times (purse, bathroom, computer table, etc.).;5.0;2323;290
2324;Tons of Uses;I have been buying Carmex in the jar for over 30 years. I have found many other uses for Carmex, for more than just soft, great, healthy lips. I love my Carmex, and do not feel dressed without it. Try it!! You will LOVE it. Thank you Carmex for keeping my lips looking and feeling the BEST!;5.0;2324;290
2325;best lip balm out there!;I LOVE Carmex lipbalm! I have been using it since I was a small child! I love the smell of it! I use it all the time!!;5.0;2325;290
2326;Almos r a necessity In Michigan;Living in Michigan you tend to have to endure some frigid winters. With the cold temperatures you also deal with cold winds that dry your skin and chap your lips. Using Carmex, you not only heal your chapped lips, you also create a great barrier that helps prevent them from capping again.;5.0;2326;290
2327;Keeps my lips moist and supple;Ive used the lip balm jar for quite a few years now. Needless to say that I have no complaints about it. Live in TX where it is hot as heck and my lips dont dry out. Just make sure you put it on before going outside, never put it on as your walking, youll get sunburned lips. No joke.;5.0;2327;290
2328;Works Like a Charm;I have been using the regular jar for over 40 years now. Carmex is great at stopping a fever blister before it even gets going. I like the little magic in the jar. It is easy to spot in cabinet and easy to feel for in bottom of my purse. Trust Carmex its the best and has been for years.;5.0;2328;290
2329;heals my lips extremely well;I have very dry and chapped lips, by the way I have a very bad habit, that I would like to rubber my lips when I feel theres dead skins on them. So my lips are often chapped and blooding. Since I use this carmex lip balsam, I can keep my lips always im guten Zustand! Really love it;5.0;2329;290
2330;love it;I got carmex 5 weeks ago and when I got it my lips were cracked after just 5 days my lips were smooth and heeld;5.0;2330;290
2331;Overnight results;I have been using this product since I was a teenager. Long summer days filled with too much sun caused havoc on my lips, but Carmex saved them. I still use it every night besides when Im in the sun. I have passed this secret down to my teenage daughters, who refuse to use anything else.;5.0;2331;290
2332;way of using carmex;I enjoyed using carmex and it was good buuuuuut mih lips is still chapped dried and it feels rrrrrough on both sides so all I wanted is just to heeeeeeeal it up to get back to smoothness;5.0;2332;290
2333;Cant live without this product;I have to have this little tub of moisture. The relief is unbelievable when my lips are chapped. Also, I find it soothing when Ive been sitting out at one of my kids games all day in the wind and sun! Honestly have one of these in my car, purse and the kids have them in their backpacks.;5.0;2333;290
2334;tissue burn;Not only does Carmex cure my chapped lips in no time, it also cures my sore and burned nose during cold and flu time. If you havent tried it on your tissue burned nose, I urge to to try it. It works so good! Plus, the minty eucalyptus type smell opens your nostrils. 3 birds, one stone!;5.0;2334;290
2335;great look and feel;My favorite lip product for years. I always keep multiples around the house and in my car.;5.0;2335;290
2336;Kid friendly, mom approved....;When my son was small, he got his own jar of Carmex and he thought he was SO big! He would put it on his lips, mosquito bites, any scratch. We bought Carmex for every car and every jacket pocket. Worked wonders....even on the bug bites! Carmex is an old family friend, trusted and loved.;5.0;2336;290
2337;All Perfect!!!!;I love Carmex!! However it is really difficult to find here in Brazil!;5.0;2337;290
2338;HOLY GRAIL;Its been a year since I started using this product and Im glad to say it changed my lips for the better! Ive recommended this product to many friends who have dry, chapped lips like myself and they share the same feelings. Definitely will be repurchasing this for a very long time.;5.0;1416;290
2339;My Go to!;Carmex lip balm jar is my absolute go to when my lips are really dry, chapped or cracked. No other will do for me. Its smooth, not greasy, and leaves my lips feeling soft and hydrated. Theres just something about the little jar packed full of relief that is a must in my household :);5.0;2339;290
2340;Is This Stuff Addicting or What!;In the jar is best! It goes on so creamy-smooth soft has a hint of vanilla scent a sweet taste w/ just the right amount of menthol. CARMEX is the best lip balm, period. I cant stop using it, especially in the winter summer months. You just dont mess w/ or replace a classic.;5.0;2340;290
2341;ALL SEASONS ....ALL REASONS;I ONLY use CARMEX and I use it year round. Summer: wind sun burned lips Spring: wind burn for extra moisture Fall: extra moisture Winter: cold sore chapped lips. ALL SEASONS for all reasons! The jar just makes it easier for carrying (when I stock up)storing! THANKYOU,CARMEX! );5.0;2341;290
2342;My Favorite;I dont know why I like the jar better than the tube or stick, but I have tried them all. I will always use the jar. Everyone says I have an addiction to Carmex. Carry it in my car, purse, next to my bed, in my desk at work. Yes..... It WORKS!!!! I lip my lips a lot and it stays on!;5.0;2342;290
2343;All these years and still awesome!;My mother used this on me when I was little and I continue to use it today. I thought I was strange because all my friends always had chapstick but not me, I had my Carmex and the most awesome thing in the world is that both me and my boyfriend use it! I guess we are just that awesome!;5.0;2343;290
2344;Tried and True That I Run To With Chapped Lips;Occasionally in the winter I get chapped lips. Not something that happens often, but when it does I absolutely must have my Carmex in the jar. It is the only thing that heals my lips fast. Ive tried other products, but Carmex is the one I depend on.;5.0;2344;290
2345;What a product!!!!!;I have been buying this product for many years and wouldnt think of buying another brand. It has stood the test of time in protecting and healing my dry chapped lips. Keep up the good work. I recommend this product to anyone. Cheers!!! for Carmex!!;5.0;2345;290
2346;Best Balm EVER;Loyal customer, fan unofficial-PR person for this product, aka best lip balm ever!!! Always perfectly moisturizing, healing and effective long after initial use. Perfect as base, lip balm or solution to chapped lips, cold sores and more! Stock up!!;5.0;2346;290
2347;Classic product;works really well during the day for long lasting moisture and overnight to loosen up that gross dead skin on your lips . Smells great I go through a bunch of them. My younger brother often tries to pull one over on me and snag a couple jars.;5.0;2347;290
2348;Nice!;The jar container is my other favorite because I can leave it in my car without worrying that it will melt and leak like the ones in the tubes sometimes do. I love that I can have the product at hand no matter where I am or where Im going.;5.0;2348;290
2349;Best ever for multiple things!;I have used Carmex since I was a little girl. I frequently get cold sores and this is the only thing that helps clear them up in a timely manner. I have tried the more expensive treatments and none worked on me. I dont leave leave home without it!;5.0;2349;290
2350;Life Saver;I have used this product for years, literally over 30 years. I work out in the weather and it heals and protects in all types of weather. Have one in my vehicle and house.;5.0;2350;290
2351;Great product - Moisturizes Plus!!;I have a problem with cold sores - usually keep Abreva on hand, but I have found that Carmex really helps with the discomfort of having a cold sore. So in addition to using it as a moisturizer, I now use it every time I have a cold sore outbreak.;5.0;2351;290
2352;Family Favorite;Carmex is a must have in my family especially in the winter time. Our grandmother taught us to buy the Carmex lip balm jar to keep favorite earrings in when it was empty!! I love how smooth it makes my lips feel and how long it protects my lips!!;5.0;2352;290
2353;Great size pot;I bought this 4 days ago as my lips had become sore in the cold weather, unfortunately I had a burning sensation on my lips, I washed it off and tried it again the next day with the same sensation.;1.0;2353;290
2354;The real OG!;This stuff may not smell the best but its perfection in a jar. Its smooth and thick but not greasy and will protect your lips especially in the winter. I use it to help cold sores heal but I also use it to help protect from them. Affordable too.;4.0;2354;290
2355;The Original is Best for Me;-I have been using Carmex since the mid 1980s when It was still in the little glass pots. I keep the empties and refill them. Theres something about the weight and feel. -I have used a lot of different lip balms and Carmex is the best by far.;5.0;2355;290
2356;Got it just in time;I had dry lips and my lips were pealing and my husband knew I needed this because I had an engagement to go to and I wouldnt go looking like this so he bought it for me and said use it and it worked in a few hours and my lips looked a lot better;5.0;2356;290
2357;seemed to help more cold sore heal faster!!!;this product seemed to help my cold sore heal faster! Ive never used it previously and this time my cold sore only lasted a few days, and didnt seem to get as bad as it usually does. Amazing for the price!!! Skip expensive Abreva and use this!;4.0;2357;290
2358;The only one I use!;I have been using Carmex Original for many years! I have tried other lip balms, but nothing works as good as Carmex. I have a bad habit of chewing my lips and I apply Carmex every night and by morning they have healed. I wont use anything else!;5.0;2358;290
2359;Cant leave home without it!;I have never run out of this caramel for as long as I can remember. I keep at least 2-3 on hand at all times. There is always 1 sitting next to me. Never stop making the container as I feel it works quicker and more effectively that the stick;5.0;2359;290
2360;Instant Results;I bought this on a whim around 5 days ago, and Im so glad I did. The results were instant and my dry, chapped lips were gone straight away, and it lasts for hours! Definitely purchasing again.;5.0;2360;290
2361;the best lip balm ever;I have used this since i was little.Its my favorite lipbalm too.I can buy lipbalms but I Will still perfer this one.I use it every night before I go to bed.;5.0;2361;290

2363;Daily Essential;I have been using for over 40 years and love. Keeps lips soft and full. Rarely do I even use lipstick for color. I prefer original jar texture to other containers. Hope to use the rest of my days for lovely lips!;5.0;2363;290
2364;Absolutely the best!;I started using Carmex as a CNA. It is the only brand I can count on to heal my supper sensitive and dry skin. I wish you sold a larger container.;5.0;2364;290
2365;This is the best lip balm in the World!;I bought it six months ago. I never have any lip balm as good as Carmex. It is very cheap and I dont have to use a lot Carmex on my lips, but it helps on my lips!;5.0;2365;290
2366;Works fast in healing!;Ive been using Carmex in the jar for a long time. Its my favorite product to use on my lips. Works nice on cracked lips, especially on the side of my mouth. One or two applications and the red dry cracks are gone!;5.0;2366;290
2367;Past to the Present;I have been using Carmex for chapped lips since my lips were always chapped when I was a kid. My Dad gave it to me and said this works great and Dads know everything. That was 64 years ago and I still use it today.;5.0;2367;290
2368;Old School Quality, Stays True;I remember being a kid and my grandma used to use this on the entire family during cold, Winter months keeping our lips healthy and soft. Never missing carmex in my purse I now continue the legacy with my children.;5.0;2368;290
2369;Its not the original formula!;I have been using Carmex for 40+ years. My old containers list Alum as an active ingredient. Your new original formula does not list Alum. What gives;1.0;2369;290
2370;Nothing Better for my lips!!;Ive been using Carmex Lip Balm for many,many years.Oh yeah,Ive been talked into trying others,but always came back to Carmex.Theres nothing better and it works fast.Carmex Lip Balm is my forever go to lip balm!!;5.0;2370;290
2371;The rescue to my lips;I love the original jar Carmex lip balm, I cant live without it during the dry and brutal winter every year. It save my lips from look like flicking fish scales to smooth as baby bottom lips. I absolutely love it.;4.0;2371;290
2372;Smaller container;The long time favorite container now has a severely indented bottom end this allowing for less product. Very disappointed by this new implementation. Smaller for the same great higher price.;2.0;2372;290
2373;Reliable Lip Care;I buy the carmex in the tub becuase it is how my mother always had it we wood open it up and smell that wonderful carmex scent. Glides on smooth but its scent is what I love the best no other brand smells like it.;5.0;2373;290
2374;Love My Carmex!!!!;I have used Carmex for years. I have tried other products but nothing compares to Carmex in keeping my lips protected from the heat of summer or the cold of winter. Thank you for making such an amazing product!;5.0;2374;290
2375;Silk in a jar;The original Carmex is my go to product. I use this every morning after washing my face and this product makes my lips feel like silk the whole day. The Carmex jar can last me a couple months too so thats a plus.;5.0;2375;290
2376;Amazing;This is the only lip product I use. I wouldnt get through the winter without it. Sometimes when I have a cold and my nose is sore I will even put a little bit on my nose before I go to bed and it really helps.;5.0;2376;290
2377;Number 1 only one!;I always prefer this one because its really very smooth to lips til the very last in the jar! Unlike the other lip balm thats not do their job after couple use.. So I always stick with this one! The original!;5.0;2377;290
2378;Memorable Moisturization;I buy these often and try to keep 1 in each purse. Love the reliability of the product... its great all year long, but especially during the fall and winter! Great for use before applying lipstick too!;5.0;2378;290
2379;Great healing balm;Ive used this for past 20 years. Bought it one winter and realized not only did it heal my chapped lips but I use it nightly and feel its keeps my lips from getting dry or cracked overnight. Love the smell too!;5.0;2379;290
2380;necessary element in first aid kit;this little jars contents are the item to go to when those stress or seasonal painful eruptions appear on my poor husbands lips. saves the day everytime and it applied soon enough shortens the time of distress.;5.0;2380;290
2381;Great packaging;I carry one of these in my purse all the time. I love that it is in a small jar so I can find it with no problem. It works great and my lips and they never get chapped when I use regularly. I love the product.;5.0;2381;290
2382;Still a favorite;I always have a jar of this in my purse on my desk. Ive used this product since I was a kid. This is the only thing that I dont get sick of, that doesnt explode all over my purse on hot days! It keeps me from chapping during the winter, which is more than I can say for any other lip product.;5.0;2382;290
2383;Lips and Cold Sores That Sometimes Do Not Heal;I bought Carmex several years ago when I had a big bad break out of cold sores that spread all over my lips. With in 2 to 3 weeks of using Carmex my lips and the cold sores were pretty much gone and the cold sores have pretty much have never come back. I have also gotten my brother to use Carmex to.;5.0;2383;290
2384;Addicted to Carmex!!!!!!;I absolutely LOVE Carmex and am totally addicted to it! I love it so much and use it so much, that I actually kept all of my jars for a whole year to see how many I use. It ended up being 210 jars in a year! I always have 1 in my pocket, 1 in my car, 1 in my purse l, and 1 by my bed at all times!;5.0;2384;290
2385;Great for severely dry/chapped lips;I have used Carmex branded products for years. My favorite is the jar. I apply this at night before bed as well as during the day. It stays on better than most other brands and my lips stay smooth and soft. I recommend all of the Carmex products. They are inexpensive and work wonders for your lips.;5.0;2385;290
2386;Lip balm;I love it because my lips get chapped real fast and I grabbe it and that is my ride buddy and do melt fast but it is good using;5.0;2386;290
2387;Use it Every Night;I had this laying around in my medicine basket, and one day I picked it up as a last resort to other lip repairs and I have to say I should of gone with this atype the start;5.0;2387;290
2388;My HG lip buddy.;I know alot of people dont like potted lip balms but I am just the opposite. Carmex not only keeps my lips soft and healthy looking but I really love that Carmex tingle and the scent is the kind of different I appreciate. Ive been using this since highschool and Im 40 so its a life long love.;5.0;2388;290
2389;A staple in our house;I have been using this product since I was a child. My mom swore by it and now as a mom of 2, I swear by it. It is the only product that I can put on my kids or my lips before going to bed and wake up with completely healed lips during winter and cold and flu season. Best lip product out there!;5.0;2389;290
2390;Love this stuff!!!;This is the only chapstick i use. It works amazing and a little bit goes a long way. Fixes chapped lips and doesnt have a nasty taste or smell. Since they are small and compact i keep one in my car, my purse, the medicine cabinet, and next to my bed. This is definitely one of my must have items.;5.0;2390;290
2391;The Best Lip Balm Ever!;I have used Carmex lip balm as far back as I can remember. It has been around for ages because it works! Its a great value. Its never sticky or greasy, does not taste or smell weird (like some other ones,) is the best value. Buy multiples to have them at home, work, in your purse etc.;5.0;2391;290
2392;My Go-To;I have used carmex for a very long time. I have a jar at work, at home, in my purse. When I feel a cold sore coming on, I immediately put some on my lips in my opinion, it definitely helps it heal much quicker. My kids know if their lips start to get chappy, they need to get their carmex on!;5.0;2392;290
2393;Always Reliable;Carmex in the original jar is my go-to for everything from wind chapped lips to winter cracking and anytime my lips just feel a little dry. It works the best every time and although Ive tried just about everything else on the planet- nothing beats Carmex. Carmex beats everything for anything.;5.0;2393;290
2394;Wonderful stuff!;The current jar I am using, I got from my mothers house after she passed. My siblings were going to throw it away. I told them to take their hands off of it because she ad just purchased it in December, and this was March. The best lip balm my mother, bless her heart, ever introduced me to you!;5.0;2394;290
2395;soothing feeling;ive been using this product a couple of days now ans has done absaloute wonders for me! ive always suffered very dry lips no matter what abd have always used vasaline that never worked, my lips are so soft and no cracks anymore!;5.0;2395;290
2396;my favourite little tin tin;This little tin of Carmex is amazing, seems to last forever and is small enough to take anywhere and everywhere without getting damaged. This product seems to be a miracle worker I go from dry chapped lips to smoothhh moisturised lips in the space of minutes. CAN NOT GET ENOUGH OF CARMEX!!!!;5.0;2396;290
2397;Perfect;Ive been using Carmex since my mom gave me a jar in high school and Ive never gone back. Nothing else works even remotely as well I wont buy any lip balm if its not Carmex. Thank you for making something so perfect! Please never change.;5.0;2397;290

I really love it and the way it makes my lips feel. Now I know what one to buy the next time I need more....Carmex!;5.0;2400;290
2401;A Tradition;I was introduced to this when I entered the Army. In the PX there was tons of this stuff. All of us recruits got a jar and boy were we glad! It helped us get thru a horrible Oklahoma winter. 23 years later I never forgot how it saved me and still use it to this day. Im sure those guys do too!;5.0;2401;290
2402;The Best!!!;Out of all the lip protectors this is the only one that works.....and I have tried a lot of different chap sticks...trying to save money or wanting to get a good flavor or just the right color...doesnt matter...Carmex is the only one that works...thank you for making it!!;5.0;2402;290
2403;The best balm;My sister has used Carmex in a jar for years. She would even put it on her eyelids at night. LOL Not quite sure why, but never had sagging skin there! I loved the fragrance started using it myself way back when. I will never use anything else. It really conditions my lips.;5.0;2403;290
2404;Good product.;Ive used Carmex for years and am very happy with the product. Im just curious, did the formula change It seems to smell different (maybe my sniffer has changed!). Please keep up the good product.;5.0;2404;290
2405;OLDIE BUT A GOODIE;For as long as I can remember Ive been using Carmex on my lips! This one in the jar is my favorite. The smallest bit goes the longest way and youll probably lose it before you run out! I love applying it before lipstick so my lips stay nice and moisturizer all day long!;5.0;2405;290
2406;Lifetime user;Been using this stuff as far back as I remember. Dont go anywhere with it. Tried several other products but not as good. Started with the jar, then the tub, and now the stick. Highly recommended! Dont even bother trying anything else, when you have the best, why bother;5.0;2406;290
2407;Above the rest!!!;A month ago my lips along with the rest of me got very sunburned and I tried the blistex I had and it wasnt helping at all. I was in the gas station and picked some carmex up and wow instant long lasting relief. Thought to myself, wish I could spread this all over my body.;5.0;2407;290
2408;Works Everytime!!!;I really like Carmex in general, I started with using the jar when I had chapped lips and I was sold the first time, by the end of the day I could feel my lips healing up. Now I have long nails so I have graduated to the lipstick looking Carmex and I love that one as well.;5.0;2408;290
2409;The best!!!!!;I have been using this for years...literally. I am 61 and have used this since the 60s;5.0;2409;290
2410;Container;I love Carmex. Love the small container that it comes in. It really works for me a lot. Especially in winter time. My face gets really dried out . I use a little bit on the dry parts of my face , it works great. Thanks for such a great product. I buy nothing but Carmex.;5.0;2410;290
2411;For Cold Sores;It works so great on my cold sores! The moment I saw one coming up and I instantly put it on and the irritation stops. Then I swear it sped up the blistering and leaking time as well and now its scanning over and healing right now. Love it!;5.0;2411;290
2412;Lip Lovers Delight;I buy this all the time and I have at least 4 open at one time in my purse, by my computer desk, right on my night stand and of course one riding my car! I have dry lips all the time and Carmex is my best friend it keeps my lips soft and moist and kissable for my husband.;5.0;2412;290
2413;Saved my lips!;Coming into Spring my lips were so dry that I couldnt even open them right up. Lipstick looked bad on me and was embarrassing. I tried Nivea, manuka honey lip balm and more! A week ago I heard the ad on the radio about Carmex, so I stopped to buy it. Best decision ever!;5.0;2413;290
2414;WORKS and feels nice too.;The others seem only to provide a barrier over the lips whereas Carmex actually moisturizes and heals them. I love this stuff. Ive used it exclusively for as long as I can remember. Let everyone else try what they will ... Ill have only Carmex!;5.0;2414;290
2415;Carmex Original Lip Balm Jar;I have used Carmex Lip Balm Jar ever since I was a little kid and though people make fun of me because Im old school I dont care...I LOVE IT!!! It gets the job done and keeps my lips smooth and protected. I appreciate it and so does my wife! :) Thanks Carmex!;5.0;2415;290
2416;Heals chapped lips overnight!;I have used CARMEX for years, it is the only lip moisturizer/therapy that works for my lips. I have tried many others including all the name brand type but CARMEX is the only one that works every time. I use it winter and summer.;5.0;2416;290
2417;Great product for chapped dry lips;I bought this one day hoping it would help. That was 5 years ago and I have used it every night since. We keep 1 on my husbands night table and on mine. My lips are slathered when I go to bed and when I wake up, they are baby soft. Love my full pout with this product.;5.0;2417;290
2418;Old Favorite Still Great;Iv been using carmex for as long as I can remember Im 57 now I tried others but always go back I like the jar because you can use what you need and its like an old friend when lips are dry the old yellow and white jar is just the ticket :) BTW I miss the glass jar :(;5.0;2418;290
2419;Old Faithful;You can always rely on a jar of Carmex to relieve your chapped lips all year round! I especially use it throughout the winter and keep one in my pocket (and the nightstand, and the kitchen, and the desk...). Ive even used it on my nose when I have a cold to protect it!;5.0;2419;290
2420;Awesome Lips in a Can;Been using lip balm for many years. Tried just about every brand. Carmex has been the best for my lips. I stopped trying brands after Carmex. And when the can was introduced, WOW!, takes away any disadvantage of tubes/rollers always keeping my lip protection protected.;5.0;2420;290
2421;Great stuff!!;Last year I was having a lot of trouble with very dry chapped lips, tried chapped stick, which normally helps. But this time it was not, so I purchased Carmex in the jar and started using it and immediately started to see relief. I keep it handy in my bathroom.;5.0;2421;290
2422;My Go-To for Chapped Lips;I have been an avid Carmex original lip balm jar user for years now. I dont think I could ever use anything else. I love the way it moisturizes my lips without feeling waxy or gunky. The price-point is completely reasonable as well.;5.0;2422;290
2423;The Best;I have bought many products for chapped lips. I bought Carmex one day years ago and loved it. Carmex is the best. I dont buy anything else now. It is also good for coldsores. I love the cool feeling on my lips. Carmex rocks!!!;5.0;2423;290
2424;Old Fashioned Favorite;Back when I was little and complained about my super dry and chapped lips I remember my dad handing me a little jar of lip stuff Now I have all forms of CarMex but this one holds memories as I apply it to fix my aweful lips.;5.0;2424;290
2425;Carmes saved my daughters vacation;Worse case of chapped lips ever! Desperate we stopped at a drug store and sked for the best and fastest cure. Was advised to use Carmex. It started working right away and in a few days the lip licking and soreness had disappeared.;5.0;2425;290
2426;The tried and true treament for dry cracked lips;My mother used this product, and now I use it and so does my grown daughter. It has worked well to heal cracked dry lips and Ive tried lots of products over the years but always come back to Carmex. Now, I wont use anything else.;5.0;2426;290
2427;I Love Carmex!;Carmex is my go to product most of the time when my lips are dry. I love the original jar just because thats what I grew up with I think, but I really love all carmex products! I love the smell, feel and how it helps my chapped lips!;5.0;2427;290
2428;My favorite carmex product;Living in the desert, it is a struggle to keep my lips from drying out and cracking. When daily summer temps are over 100 degrees daily, protecting my lips is important. The ONLY thing that works is carmex! I prefer the original jar.;5.0;2428;290
2429;Best lip balm ever!!!!!!!;I used to use eos and I found out that I was allergic to it so I stuck with Carmex. Carmex is the best lip balm in the world!!!;5.0;2429;290

2431;The Original;Carmex jarred lip balm reminds me of being a little girl and going to the water park with my family. My mom would put it on my lips to prevent them from being sunburned. She always carried it in her purse....and now, so do I. :);5.0;2431;290
2432;multi use;I buy this every year. Its a must have for the winter months. Not only is it great for your lips but its also great for the rough egdes of your nose when its chapped. Always has been the greatest product. And it also smells good.;5.0;2432;290
2433;Overall feel and protection it gives to my lips .;I have been using Camex in the jar for the last 4 yrs. I used it once in the morning also again before I go to sleep. I enjoy the way it feels and protects my lips. My wife says I crazy for as many times I apply the wax to my lips.;5.0;2433;290
2434;Dont go anywhere with out my Carmex Jar!!;I have been a fan of Carmex for years! I wish I could remember when I first used Carmex for my cold sore, but Im sure it was 20 years ago and I never leave home without one in my purse. Love, Love, Love this product..Thanks!!!!;5.0;717;290
2435;Love this Carmex;This is the only lip balm I purchase. My lips get dry easily and I get a cold sore a couple times a year. Once I feel a cold sore coming on, I apply this and can feel it start to work immediately. I would recommend this to anyone!;5.0;2435;290
2436;History with Carmex;I have been using Carmex since I was a little girl because of my Mom. Carmex is her absolute favorite lip balm and I dont blame her! She has also been using Carmex forever. I have never had a lip balm work as well as Carmex.;5.0;2436;290

2440;The Original is KING!;The minute my lips cant take anymore of the harsh conditions of the Florida sun I reach for the cooling and soothing relief of my old stand-b, Carmex Lip Balm in the jar. I apply it at night and by morning my lips are healed. This is a go to product you will rely on again and again!!;5.0;2440;290
2441;Love this product!;I have used this product for over 10 years. It is part of my makeup routine before applying lipstick in the morning, and used throughout the day. I dont know what I would do without Carmex during the winter season living in the Midwest. It keeps my lips moisturized and looking great!;5.0;2441;290
2442;You cant go wrong with this trusty friend;I always keep carmex on hand. It is always nice to have during harsh summer sun or cold IA winters. Gives your lips healing security. Toss it in your purse or keep it in your pocket always there to heal. Nothing compares for those dreaded cold sores that peak during the flu season.;5.0;2442;290
2443;Instant Protection;There are harsh cold winters and dry summers in Chicago which can really affect my lips. Moisture and protection is what I wanted and so I bought this product for those reasons. Not only did it deliver but it also healed my chapped lips. Only negative is that I have to use my finger.;4.0;2443;290
2444;Great product. Stop changing!;Nearly 40. Been using this for years on lips and cuticles. I wish the packaging didnt change. The inverted bottom isnt right. Wish there was a vegan version was available. How is the lanolin derived for this product My favorite before all the changes.;3.0;2444;290
2445;best lip medicine EVER;I have been using carmex for decades and will not use anything else. We lived in Maryland in the late 80 s and I could not find it there.

2447;Kissable Lips;I have been using this product for about 8 years. I started because I was getting very chapped lips and nothing was helping. I use it in the morning and at night everyday. Have not had chapped lips, or cold sores in 8 years. I recommend to anyone who has problems with their lips.;5.0;2447;290
2448;Lasts forever;I have been buying the Carmex jar as long as I can remember. The reason I have bought it for so many years is I was in the military and would throw it in my bag work bag. I never had the jar crushed or come open even when the bag was tossed around and all my gear would hit it.;5.0;2448;290
2449;We love Carmex;We us both use the original jar and tube. My son use it all the time. I buy it in bulk. Mu son use it a lot, he is outside with sports. So we have to keep a lot of it. We dont see much of the other flavors, just strawberry or cherry, we stick to the originals jars and tubes.;5.0;2449;290
2450;Great Product;I buy this type of Carmex all the time! It is my favorite one out of all the choices. I am always using it when the corners of my mouth crack.

2451;26 years and counting!;I have used Carmex for over 26 years! I dont go anywhere without a tub or stick.

2453;This stuff really works!!!;I have used Carmex for as long as i can remember. The fragrance is what drew me in. I thought well, at least my lips will smell good But i was pleasantly surprised at how moist and smooth it kept my lips. I have a jar of Carmex at my desk, one in my purse and I never run out.;5.0;2453;290
2454;WORKS AMAZING;Having a daughter with excema is hard so when ever she suffers from sever dry lips and cold soars i always can count on Carmex to deliver. Works amazing and helps heal dry chaps lips. Love how its helps the itchy feeling and protects her lips from sun exposure and cracking.;5.0;2454;290
2455;best stuff on earth!;I have been a big fan of the Carmex jar since I was a little girl in elementary school. This would be the only product I would let my parents buy me.

2456;Works great!;I love this product! Its the original and the one that I first used b/c my dad always used it and swore by it.

2457;The best.;I have been buying this version of car next lip care since I was 12. I am now 26 years old, it is a regularly used part of my beauty regime. Keeps your lips soft smooth for hours. Using this product regularly also keeps those dry, irritated winter lips away. Its amazing!;5.0;2457;290
2458;excellent for smacking lips;I bought this size container for my dad very often. He always had sore corners of his mouth, and he loved the round container. He wanted to always be ready for kisses (from me and his nurses), and it always healed the corners of his mouth w/o a bad taste. He used it daily.;5.0;2458;290
2459;reliable;I love this stuff I was addicted to bliss stick but for the last 5 years I ran across this at the store it was so smooth and not greasy on my lips and I have bought it faithfully every year I dont really care for the cherry but I will use it even my grandkids call it by name they have to have their own personal one also we love it;5.0;1433;290
2460;Life Staple;The big thing in high school was to always have car ex in the jar. I graduated in 1987 and have been using ever since.

Love this product!;5.0;2460;290
2461;burning like a hot chilli;I bought this 3 days a ago and Im a first time user of this brand and not sure if I use again as my lips are on fire every time I apply is this a normal reaction Or am I just using the wrongs thing because thousands of people across the world rave about how amazing it is feedback would be great to hear;1.0;2461;290
2462;It lasts longer than lip balm sticks!;I had tried a new lip butter. But went back to Carmex Original Lip Balm Jar because it lasts longer, and is less expensive. I used to apply lip balm sticks during the day, and Carmex Jar at night, but the lip balm sticks dont last. So now I use the jar all day, too. I even bought a package of 12 jars because it saves me money!;5.0;2462;290
2463;Old Standby;I grew up with this in my house. My mom always had some that she used all the time in the winter also whenever she got a cold sore. I never had any colds sores, so I do not know if it really helps with that, but I do know that it is great for those dry,cracked windburned lips that those of us living up North get every winter.;4.0;2463;290
2464;smooth soft lips all day;This is my go to lipbalm. I apply in the morning maybe 5 am. and i let it sink in and all day i have the feeling of comfort. no dry lips. no reaplying. unless it aroung the time I go to sleep. perfect solution for dry lips. it gives my lips a healthy look .its also great to apply before lipstick. Im so happy with this product.;5.0;2464;290
2465;A Tin thats a Ten in Care;Nostalgic, classic jar, heals raw feeling cold sores or chap with ease. Its a must for me in Florida.Helps fade dark spots of dark skin, economical price, easy to find in stores. I first started using it years ago after a pharmacy employee recommended it as an over-the-counter cure for my inquiry on healing the side of my lip.;5.0;2465;290
2466;A Neccesity!!;Ive been using Carmex for more than 5 years now and I have literally nothing bad to say about it! I cant leave the house without it and it really soothes my dry lips. I even use it now as a primer before I put on any lipstick just so that my lipstick sets moist and nice. This item is highly recommended and very addicting! :D;5.0;2466;290
2467;Loving the tingle;My sister has a jar of this and I have to say I just love the tingleas you can literally feel the product rejuventating your lips. Its not as greasy and some other products which is great as it does not feel like you have a layer or oil on your lips haha. Carmex also smells amazing and is worth every penny! 5/5 from me!:);5.0;2467;290
2468;Could not live without it!;I have using this farmed in the Lip Balm Jar for as long as I can remember. Not o lyrics does it help the moisture of my lips but that little jar has been a part of just about every life event. It attended my wedding, the birth of my children and numerous other events. To me it is more than a way of life it is part of my life.;5.0;2468;290
2469;Favorite lip balm on the market!;I come from a long line of Carmex users absolutely could NOT live without it! I keep at least 3 bottles (if not more) in my home at all times... one in my purse, one in my bathroom, one in my living room so that no matter where I am theres Carmex nearby (that tells you how much I use it love it)! ) I highly recommend it!;5.0;2469;290
2470;My favorite lip product!;I have loved Carmex in a jar since I was a little kid- I am biased as Im from Wisconsin and Carmex is a Wisconsin company, but that just means they understand how chapped lips and skin can get! This is the only thing I have ever used that actually WORKS and it works overnight most times I have dry skin on my lips. I love it!;5.0;2470;290
2471;Best carmex ever;For 4 years i gave been sort of addicted to always have carmex with me wherever i go. I cant sleep unless i have carmex on my lips. I love carmex and i will always use it and nothing else because carmex is the best for my lips!;5.0;2471;290
2472;We Go Way Back!;I have used Original Carmex in the jar for many years. It never lets me down. It gives me the relief I need and the healing that I want. Its tried and true for me and Ill continue to use it for years to come. Ive tried the other Carmex varieties and tje tubes but the Original jar is my favorite. A bit of nostalgia for me!;5.0;2472;290
2473;LOVE this Jar;I bought this originally to soothe my painful cold sores. It was one of the ONLY products that actually worked and didnt make them dry out. I continued using this product lonnnngggg after cold sores were a problem in my life. It is so soothing and moisturizing, Im definitely a carmex snob. No other product works this good!;5.0;2473;290
2474;Wonderful product.;My daughter introduced me to Carmex lip balm. I use it every day, and find the initial tingle when applied so refreshing. But I find it difficult to find stockists for it. Can you tell me of all places that stock it in Coventry.;5.0;2474;290
2475;Will never go back;One day after years of battling chapped lips someone suggested I try Carmen so I did low and behold it worked better then any other chap items I had used whether it was Chapstick or Vaseline or any lip balms etc I still put a small coat on my lips even if they are not chapped just because it prevents chapping and feels good;5.0;2475;290
2476;SAVE YOUR LIPS!!;Ihave used this product since I came back to Chicago in 1991 as a home care RN i have been exposed to the elements over and over in a day,Carmex has saved my lips! I stocked up buying boxes as my son entered kindergarten as he always would leave them somewhere as young boys do.Hes 21 and still using the products.Thanks!;5.0;2476;290
2477;Perfect packaging;I use nothing but Carmex for chapped lips. This is my all time favorite package because it is rugged and durable and can go anywhere - from being tucked into a jeans pocket to the bottom of a backpack. Easiest method to apply just the right amount too!;5.0;2477;290
2478;Best Product;My family and I have been using Carmex for decades. It is the best item on the market for keeping your lips and mouth healthy. I even send my daughter in Wisconsin 2 Carmex products since the winters are long. A third generation is now using the product.;5.0;2478;290
2479;best on cold sores;better than any other treatment for cold sores. Does not dry it out and heals faster. One more area it is great on is sore fingernails. Yep, thats right. Ever cut too short that it hurts. Try putting some carmex from the jar on it, relieve is on the way;5.0;2479;290
2480;Used for 40 years, a great product, great price!;Ever since I started skiing in Colorado And found out about Carmex it is all I will ever use. Great lip protection in all weather conditions. I have been a loyal user for over 40 years, other products come and go but none of them ever match up to Carmex!;5.0;2480;290
2481;stays on and is moist;I had an appointment with a new Dentist and she put Carmex on my lips to keep them moist,well ever since that day I always buy Carmex,I love this product it keeps my lips soft,shiny,moist and stays on long too. I would definetely recommend this product !;5.0;2481;290
2482;LOVE CARMEX;CARMEX, has helped my dry, thyroid cancer skin.. I just love this. My lips, and such get so dry.. It is a perfect product.. I love the jar, cause it fits in the purse, glove compartment, pocket, etc... Lasts long also.. Only a little Dab will do it...;5.0;2482;290
2483;Great price;Great price on this very good product;5.0;2483;290
2484;Keeping it classic;Im a huge fan of Carmex and the little classic jar. First off Carmex feels great on the lips and the smell is very appealing. The little jar is just so old school Im glad its still available. I highly recommend Carmex over all for your chap lip needs;5.0;2484;290
2485;Mother always had several jars;My Mother was actually buried (2001) with a jar of Carmex in one hand and a kleenex in another. She was NEVER seen without either. I would purchase the Carmex jar by the box for her! She would have a jar always within a few feet (if not closer) to her.;4.0;2485;290
2486;Best of the best;I am, by far, the first to go the natural route for anything. However, Carmex is the best lip balm that I have ever found. There just isnt anything quite like it: healing, penetrating, numbing. If I could be addicted to a lip balm, this would be it.;5.0;2486;290
2487;Nothing more comforting than this little jar!;I have been using Carmex forever. When you see the little jar you know that relief is just seconds away. This original product reminds me of going to the drugstore and seeing the little jar right by the cash register. Great memories of a great product.;5.0;2487;290
2488;My must-have always;I use this product religiously. If I forget it at home when I go to work, I get another jar on my way to work. I cant go without it. My lips are always dry and chapped... as I am a lip chewer.... and Carmex always helps my lips heal, and stop hurting.;5.0;2488;290
2489;Carmex...Who What When;I dont know when carmex was invented, but I was 10 years old when I started using it...my lips were split and blistered from the cold Wisconsin winter, the Pharmacist in our local Drug store recommended it... I still use it today and I am 64 years old!;5.0;2489;290
2490;Works Great!;Ive been using this for years it is awesome! Works for dry, chapped lips, even works on break outs! Yes, it works on pimples!!! Try it, it works! I always keep some in my bedroom, one in my purse one in the bathroom! Love it! Thank you, Carmex!;5.0;2490;290
2491;Timeless!;Carmex Original Lip Balm Jar has been a staple in my life my entire life! Its a must in the car, purse, backpack, diaper bag and I wouldnt be exaggerating if I told you its in every room of my house. It just simply WORKS! No muss, no fuss, no waste!;5.0;2491;290
2492;Cant live without it!;If I dont have 3 Carmex in my bag, I dont leave home. 1 pot, 1 stick, 1 tube. I think am addicted :) Truth is am prone to cold sores and need to use it often to safeguard my lips. Wish you had special deals for clients who cant live without it....;5.0;2492;290
2493;Excellent Effective Product;Ive been using this Carmex product for many years, and it still works the same as it always did!! Carmex does a great job keeping my lips moisturized, especially in colder weather. Even when I dont have dry lips, I consistently moisture with Carmex.;5.0;2493;290
2494;gross smell;i bought this and it is really good, but is smells really bad;4.0;2494;290
2495;My go-to for lip care!!;I have been buying Carmex since I was a teenager. Through the years, many new products have came out. I have tried them all! In the end, I always found myself back to using Carmex!! The ONLY lip product that has worked for me, time and time again!!;5.0;2495;290
2496;Mmmmm...;Love that smell.. works great too! And congrats on the sponsorship of the Lambeau College football game in Sept. What a great honor. I hope to make it! Go WI and Go Bucky!;5.0;2496;290
2497;Long Lasting, Great Taste, Best Results !;I love Carmex Original Lip Balm in a jar. I use it all the time. It works not only on your lips, but also for problem skin areas like ears, hairline, chin, elbows, etc. I love the consistency and the flavor. It lasts a long time and helps to heal any kind of skin. Just wish it came in a larger size than .50 oz. I would love a 2 or 4 oz size !;5.0;2497;290
2498;Excellent lip maintenance!;I put this stuff on every night before I go to bed. It keeps my lips happy, healthy, and soft-- plus, I like the tingle. I had a boyfriend who hated that I do that because he didnt like anything squidgy on my lips in the event he might want to kiss me. Boyfriend gone. Carmex still on my lips every night-- enough said! Choose your battles.;5.0;2498;290
2499;AZ desert no match for my faithful tub of Carmex!;Ive used Carmex ever since I moved to this arid climate and spent a weekend at a friends house that lived off the beaten path. By Sunday my lips were parched and I was miserable. We went to a local store and I lucked upon a shiny tub of golden lip relief. I keep 6-8 of them in the house, a couple in my truck, and a couple more on my desk.;5.0;2499;290
2500;best ever!;I buy this every time I need something for my lips. Its the best I even buy some for back up, to have some put back just in case. I dont use anything else. I definitely recommend it to my friends and every one. Its good for everything if I have dry cracked lips or chapped lips. Anything its my go to saver! I love it. Nothing else compares!;5.0;2500;290
2501;Terrific results!;Ive been using this product for umpteen years now. My family is prone to getting cold sores (Ive been getting them since 1st grade,Im now 34) i only trust this product as all the other stuff out there is way to expensive and doesnt work.carmex is fantastic and works in a very short time.. i use every product on the line now.i love it!;5.0;2501;290
2502;It worked when nothing else did;Be it a high end lip balm, round ball ones or anyother that has been on the market for long Carmex by far works the best than any other. I also noticed that it doesnt chap my lips if I stop using the product. I am not addicted to this mild but beautifully scemted charm . Thankyou for pampering me Carmex !;5.0;2502;290
2503;My favorite nighttime product;I keep the jar next to my bed, it s my favorite thing I have found for my lips. It stays on all night, and I wake up with soft lips. I like the light scent, the way it feels. It works so well. This is also one of the best things in winter time. Nothing else works as well!! It is cheap, bit NOT cheaply made. Budget friendly fantasticness!;5.0;2503;290
2504;This oldie is not only a goodie but a must have!;I love this product. My family has been using this product for years and every time I see a jar it brings back old memories from when I was a child. I love that they have not veered from being their original self and are still a brand my family trust to this day. Great product and you can always count on it to help protect your pucker.;5.0;2504;290
2505;Daily Care;I have been using Carmex for over ten years and I am lost without it. There is two jars in my purse, one in my car and one in my desk drawer at all times. I have not had a cold sore, chapped lips or flaky lips from the sun in these ten years. People talk about their daily exercising, well my daily care includes a dip for my lips (Carmex).;5.0;385;290
2506;What happened;Maybe more a question then the review. I have been using original Carmex for years. Recently I bought 2 pots of it and I was shocked, as my beloved salve seem different. Smell texture and feel is rather questionable. This is a lot 14996. Please tell me you have not change the formula!!!;1.0;2506;290
2507;Lifesaver!;Im a girl that adores her Chap Stick, though my trusty sidekick did nothing to fight off my extremely chapped lips that I had last week. I bought a jar of Carmex and with only a few applications, my very dry lips were back to normal in 24 hours!! Thank you :);5.0;2507;290
2508;Healing power!;I always buy at least 4 jars of Carmex to have on hand, 3 are at home and 1 is in my purse at all times. Winter weather is fast approaching and I have severe dry lips and usually get a cold sore at some point and Carmex softens and protects my lips throughout the winter months. Very reliable and trustworthy to get the protection done.;5.0;2508;290
2509;My favorite of all!;Ive used this Carmex in the original jar for as long as I can remember. My mom started us on it when we were little and to this day it is still my go to for chapped or dry lips and just a good moisturizer over all and I love the menthol. There is nothing else like it. I have one in my truck and one on my nightstand at all times.;5.0;2509;290
2510;When the cold winds blow.........;As soon as a cold snap occurs, it time to buy jars of Carmex, leave it in bathroom, kitchen and bedroom. This way you have access to it, all the time. The climate gets very dry - and zaps your lips. For me, Carmex is never out of reach - the best product to keep your lips from chapping especially when shoveling in cold winter months.;5.0;2510;290
2511;The Lip Helper;I have bought so many of these in the past years..Having a son in the military this was a life saver for when he was in Iraq and Afgahanintan...He was my oldest and then my middle son uses this daily and has started his daughter to use it and my yougest uses this also...and of course I do too....thanks for having such a great product;5.0;2511;290
2512;Always Reliable;This original Carmex has been around since I was a child. I remember I used to get painful chapped lips from playing outside during the winter when I was little and my Mom would always use this product to help heal/soothe my lips. It is a product that has stood the test of time and is still available today and for that I am thankful.;5.0;2512;290
2513;Best Lip Balm Ever!;I have been using this for years. My lips are always very soft and this is the only lip care item that prevents fever blisters for me. My 9 year old daughter swears by it too. I buy 10 at a time to make sure we always have plenty on hand. I have bought more expensive products and always come back to my CARMEX. I love this stuff!!!;5.0;2513;290
2514;Still use after all these years;I have been using Carmex in the small glass jar (I believe it is plastic now) for many many years!!!! I have always loved the distinctive smell of Carmex and the tingle when I piut it on. The jar may seem tiny, but it lasts for a long time. I have Carmex by my bed and in my purse and I have even tried Carmex lotion and love it too!;5.0;2514;290
2515;Life saver!;How can you go without using the Carmex in the original yellow jar. I use Carmex all day long. A preserver for my lips 365 days a year. Even my Dentist keeps the jar in the drawer for patients to keep moist lips. I drive every other week to Atlanta and the Carmex is always with me. A life saver and preserver for me and my family.;5.0;2515;290
2516;28 Years;I was 17 when I first started to use it. I went to visit my granny and got a really bad cold sore. She got carmex for me and the cold sore was gone in three days. I have been using it ever since and Im 45 now.;5.0;2516;290
2517;Happy;Happy;5.0;2517;290
2518;Love the Jar;I love the jar becuase I love touching my lips and I love the idea of being able to control the amount of Carmax you want on your finger. The Jar is also most ideal when wanting to share with friends and family as you dont have to worry about their lips touching your stick. Each person gets their own individual amount. The Jar is the best! ALSO if you happen to get a cold sore you dont have to scrape of the top layer on the stick wasting product as to prevent the cold sore from coming back and spreading. Using a jar keeps your lips from wasting product.;5.0;2518;290
2519;Thank God for Carmex;Having cold sores has to be one of the worst and discomforting things ever, when I first tried Carmex, I immediately felt relief. Really its indescribable how awesome Carmex is. I have used pretty much every other line of Chapstick or any lip reliever in the market l, but none have come close to Carmex. Since I started using Carmex, thats all I use. I keep two in my purse and I keep at home as well. My lips are finally kissable! Thanks to Carmex! Thank you for such an amazing product. God bless you guys for helping so many.;5.0;2519;290
2520;The Only Lip Care You Will Ever Need!!!;I use to suffer from very dry, cracked lips year round for years! I have tried Every brand on the market, websites. By chance I saw this product gave it a try-WOW! Ive used this every day/night for the past 10 yrs., the pain, discomfort is a non issue! !! It keeps my lips hydrated, no chance for cold sores, my lips are ready each day!! Thank you so very much for this Awesome product, Ive shared these as stocking suffers for all my friends and family! The cost is so reasonable also!! Thank you again-from happy lips in Cuyahoga falls, Ohio! !!;5.0;2520;290
2521;Prevents and Treats Dry, Chapped Skin;I use this product particularily in the cold winter months, and it does a great job of protecting my lips from the weather. I put this Thick gel (a little goes a long way!) Under lipcolor during the day, generously on my lips as a conditioning treatment during the night, and on the skin Near my nose when Im sick that gets dried and irritated from blowing my nose. This product works and is a budget-friendly staple For anyones makeup collection. My only complaint is Im not a fan of the smell, in the future would love a less stinky/medicated scent;4.0;2521;290
2522;Nothing wrong with original!;I usually always buy Carmex when it comes to lip balm and the original jar is one of my go-to Carmex products. I do love the cherry and tubes but the jar is very convenient to have around, and less likely to lose! It lasts forever as well! I apply it every day, multiple times a day and it still looks like I havent made a dent in the product after a month! It keeps my lips moisturizer for hours and doesnt leave a greasy residue or doesnt feel sticky like other lip balms do. highly recommend this to keep at your desk for work or in your purse!;5.0;2522;290
2523;Addictive must have.;I know people claim that Carmex is addictive, and I know that you claim its not. Either way, I love it. I slather virtually half of my face with it prior to bed each night (I dont wear it during the day, because I dont like feeling the least bit greasy). Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I love Carmex. I once forgot to bring my Carmex with me on business trip, and I was stuck buying an over-priced ChapStick in a hotel lobby. And boy, is that stuff junk. It felt like I was spreading old cheese on my lips. This is an any day must have.;5.0;2523;290
2524;Dry sore lips Best friend;Are used to lick my lips causing them to become extremely dry with a dark ring around my mouth and my lips peeling . My cousin suggested that I try Carmax this has been years ago . I now carry Comex everyplace I go its in my car in my purse beside my bed I cant be without it it has become my best friend my lips are no longer dry sore or cracking I would recommend this product to everyone my 15-year-old nephew man uses it because he was experiencing the same problems I had it he no longer has that problem thank you;5.0;2524;290
2525;The Original is a Classic a Staple in My Life;Ive used the Carmex Original in the Lip Balm Jar for as long as I can remember, ever since someone introduced it to me either in late elemtary or middle school. So many many memories are associated with this simple little product that has grown up with me for 34+ years! I love how its never really changed except for some minor changes to the jar during those years until now these genius additions to the line that has only made it better.thank you Carmex for being there being such an important part of my ever changing life!;3.0;2525;290
2526;Best stuff EVER!!!!!!;I cant even tell you how many years I have been using the Carmex tub, but I will never use anything else. I LOVE CARMEX!!!!!!!! I am totally addicted to it and my lips are always so soft. I put it on every night before bed and my lips are good the whole day. I have tried so many different products for chapped lips and this is by far the absolute best product on the market!!!!!! The price and quality of the product are incredible. The other ones out there dont work and cost too much money. Keep it up guys, I love you!!!!!!!;5.0;2526;290
2527;Carmex- It made your first kiss perfect;I have been using Carmex in its familiar pot since high school. I remember it like yesterday. The girls gathered in the ladies room between classes to gossip, giggle, brush our hair and put on Carmex to soften our lips. We had to be ready just in case the cute boy we crushed on spoke to us. We wouldnt be kissing in class, but, we followed the ritual so our lips would be perfect. I still love the feeling of it on my lips and taking that 1st inhale, that makes your lips tingle and your thoughts travel to a sweet memory.;5.0;2527;290
2528;great for in night stand;I love keeping a jar at home for use before bed or if I need it during the night. I also keep a jar for each of my kids especially during the winter, when lips get chapped the most. They lick their lips and cause that ring around the mouth that this product helps get rid of fast. They keep theirs by their beds in case they need it during night also. I like the how smooth it is and the scent is also very pleasant! My kids like the smell of it especially when having a cold, it seems to help them clear their nose better.;5.0;2528;290
2529;Awesome Product!;I remember back when I was a small child, my father would always be on my case about putting Carmex on my lips because they were always so sore and chapped. Of course a 7 year old wouldnt care... Until the winter came. My lips were so chapped and I started getting cold sores all over my mouth. So I finally listened to my dad about putting Carmex on my lips. Ever since I started , I never stopped. Carmex Is such an amazing product ! My lips have never again got crusty and I havent had a sore since elementary school.;5.0;2529;290
2530;THE Best Lip Balm;I began using Carmex in high school. I had really bad acne and started an acne treatment that really dried my face and lips out. The dermatologist told me to use Carmex. I am now 50 years old and I still use it. I have to put it on in the morning after applying my makeup, and reapply several times throughout the day. Then after I have removed my makeup for the night and right before I go to bed, I reapply. I cannot go to sleep without it. My husband uses it almost as much as I do. Excellent product. Thank you.;5.0;2530;290
2531;I cant wait for the smell of the jar.;When I open a jar of Carmex. I cant wait for the cooling smell it has. Soft as butter, goes on like silk. Protects my lips from wind, rain, and sun. I wear it to sleep to keep my lips moist and supple. I even use it in my nose when the house is dry to keep it loose and soft. I think Carmex is the best on the market. Low in price, high in quality. Ive used it for many years. When my kids were little I would use it for cold sores and chapped lips and cheeks. Keep up the excellent work. Sincerely Tina d Utecht;5.0;2531;290
2532;Old School;Ive been using the pot Carmex since the 70s! I have loved it all these years! Back in the day anyone we were with would say, can I use your Carmex It was the only lip protection referred to. Someone always had Carmex on them. After all these years, the pot Carmex has not lost its fabulous-ness. Theres just something about applying Carmex to your lips with your finger. Try it to see how smooth it glides on to all the right places for instant relief, and a healthy little shine to your lips.;5.0;2532;290
2533;cold sores;I have been using carmex for over 5 years because I get cold sores every year and I have used nexcare and abreava and those are way expensive too,and I noticed that those take a week for your cold sore to hear and so I tried the carmex and its like gone in a day. I actually got a cold sore yesterday 8/31 and its gone today. I told my daughter about it a while back because she had a sore and she even used it. I even recommend it to a lady at the store but I dont think she took my word for it.;5.0;2533;290
2534;PERFECT!!;So, I bought my first Carmex three years ago I think, because I saw a friend had it. I just love it. I use it when I wake up, during the day when needed and before I go to bed. My lips havent been dry in THREE YEARS!! How amazing isnt that I have used one of this jar, and I am halfway through the second one, so one and a half jar in three years - amazing. I also got the cherry one recently and I love the scent of it. Ah, this product is just perfect and I really recommend it to everyone!;5.0;2534;290
2535;Awesome product in the cold or in the heat;I have been using this particular Carmex product for several years. The Original lip balm jar has been a staple in my purse and in my 4 kids Christmas stockings every year for the past several years. Three of my kids are grown and they still want Carmex for Christmas. I give them several jars so they have it all year! This product keeps lips from chapping in the Minnesota cold and also from the Arkansas heat! ( I have lived several years in both states) I love this product so much!;5.0;2535;290
2536;the original;the name says it all... the original that started all of this CARMEX CRAZE!!! i dont know about all of you, but i graduated in 1997 CARMEX has been going strong for years, even since i was in school LOL love it cant live without it. ALSO, all the other CARMEX products flavors are TOTALLY AMAZING! i just figured i would go with the original because it is the single product that started these amazing products (that actually do their job do it properly) thank you CARMEX;5.0;2536;290
2537;the best thing of the world;If you never tried it, its time for you to do it. Keep your lips moist and healthy;5.0;2537;290
2538;Original Carmex Design;Im going to do a review on the 1st product made by Carmex, because this one is the first one I have ever tried. Its what got me hooked on this Lip Balm where it all started. I tried this product when I was 12 years old, my lips were so chapped that it was so painful and red. As soon as my aunt and uncle purchased it for me, it stopped my pain right away and within a couple of days, it was gone. I have never had a problem with this product and as of today I still carry Carmex in my purse. A+ for this product made by Carmex and its affordable. Thank you for making my life easier. Your 1 Fan Lia Anderson, from Flint, Mi;5.0;2538;290
2539;Best stuff on earth;I grew up in a skating rink! That means I had multiple mothers and fathers watching out and over us! It also means I had multiple grandmothers that were willing to share their knowledge. This product is part of their knowledge! 30 years later and I am still using this product religiously. I keep it in my pocket. I keep it in my hunting backpack. I keep it in my truck console. I keep it on the nightstand! I mean this product is within reach 24/7! Not only does it help with crack and chapped lips. It also helps with cold sores! I now share my knowledge and love for this product every chance I get! Great great product!;5.0;2539;290
2540;Great Stuff shame about misleading packaging;always use this and it works a treat however there is a massive dent built in the bottom of the classic jar which makes it look like you are getting more for your money. The squeezie tube is better value for money - same price with more product;3.0;2540;290
2541;Great Lip Balm;Ive been using Carmex for the past two years. This product keeps your lips moist and smooth. I got to say that before I started using Carmex I normally used to get cold sores and other cold sore products did not help at all. I tried all of them, like Abreva and spent so much money on products like that and my cold sores took a long time to heal or got worse. My friend told me about Carmex, so I tried Carmex when I had the sores and I it was amazing how my sore was diminishing and was gone so quickly. I always keep Carmex in my bag, dresser, in my car. Definitely would recommend this product to friends and family.;5.0;2541;290
2542;great product;I am prone to severe chapped lips. If I dont use chap stick every day my lips dry out to the point that they crack and bleed. Unlike most chap sticks which work for a few hours then need to be reapplied (every 2 or 3 hours) the Carmex jar is long lasting. I can put it on twice a day (before work and before bed) and my lips are fine sometimes I can even get do fine using it just once a day if the weather isnt harsh. If its really cold or dry I still only need to use chap stick mid-day once when I use the carmex morning and night, which is a vast improvement. I love it. Added bonus the jar is my favorite color.;5.0;2542;290
2543;Smooth soft lips!;I bought my carmex jar about a month or so ago because I live in Georgia and its so easy to get dry lips with this hot, dry weather! So, I decided to try it out! After one week my boyfriend and I both noticed changes and my lips are so soft now! He however doesnt like carmex do to the oily feeling and the taste to him is rather undelightful. However one day I left my jar in the car by accident and when I came back it was melted! The hear from outside actually fully melted it! But after bringing it inside it came right back to life and have had no problems with it. I was rather happy about that!;5.0;2543;290
2544;The ultimate lip care product.;Ive tried countless lip care products from countless brands across different price points, and nothing beats the Carmex Original Jar. It instantly soothes dry lips and regular application helps keep your lips looking and feeling great. This formulation is great to use year-round as its emollient both in colder and hotter weather. Do yourself a favor and apply as liberally and as often as possible. You wont regret it.;5.0;2544;290
2545;The Best and ADDICTING;I just brought this Carmex Lip balm because my lips are VERY Chapped and DRY and I LOVE it and its cute little container that I can store pretty much anywhere.I have never used a lip balm as much as this one and have only had it for 2 days and I have already seen a improvement in my lip moisture and no other lip balm has shown that much improvement for me so soon.And I have stocked up and brought like 10 more to last me for a month I hope,but I might need more.But I like how it feels minty or refreshing on my lips.So I plan on sticking with your product because its perfect for me :).;5.0;2545;290
2546;Amazing lip product;I have used carmex for many years but for a while i had forgot about it and it got pushed to the back of a draw. however recently i found it and remembered how moisturising it is on the lips and that great tingly minty feeling the balm gives you. i always have dry chapped lips but using carmex has allowed my lips to heal and make them feel soft. now i could not live with out it i have a jar in all of my bags and around my house and apply it multiple times a day and before bed i apply a generous amount to work as a lip mask over night to give me luscious lips in the morning.;5.0;2546;290
2547;Invigorating healing power;I am a lifelong Carmex user. Not only does it keep my lips from drying and cracking during the searing summer months and frigid winter months, but when I used to play in the marching band, it was an indispensable tool I would never go without. Playing a wind instrument in extreme weather conditions can be murder on your lips but Carmexs invigorating healing power kept my lips fresh, safe, and protected - even under the most punishing conditions. It doesnt wear off easily like some other brands and you can actually feel it healing your lips immediately.This stuff works miracles!;5.0;2547;290
2548;Best product out there;Ive used this product in the pot for over 20 yrs til it came out in a tube, Ive used the tube ever since. Ive tried everything on the market and nothing works like it does. I still dont like the smell or flavor but Im hooked. Ive tried the cherry and didnt care for it at all. Have you every thought about vanilla or mint in the tube Because I find the vanilla in the stick to be the right smell/flavor but I dont like the texture and it doesnt last like the original on your lips. Thank you I have tube all over my house and everywhere I go. If not I have to stop and buy some.;5.0;2548;290
2549;Super magical results!;This product is awesome! My nose and lips were raw from a nasty cold. Carmex soothed and healed this severe chapped skin in seconds! I was looking for a product with the healing product of lanolin and was pleased to find it is the second main ingredient! Thanks to carmex Im back to feeling great!;5.0;2549;290
2550;I always keep afresh one handy.;I discovered Carmex Original Lip Balm more than ten years ago. Since then Ive never used a different brand. The soothing difference is like night day. I am constantly recommending Carmex lip balm to all my friends even acquaintances that display an immediate need to get some relief from chapped lips cold sores, as I know beyond a reasonable doubt that I end up a Hero! Without exception they love it, too cant believe theyve just discovered it. I always have an unopened/unused tube with me that I then give to the newest convert! The love is overwhelming! Thanks Carmex.;5.0;2550;290
2551;wonderfully healthy lips!;Ive exclusively used carmex for 36 yrs! Its the last thing i do before going to bed at night! My lips have not been chapped once in all those years! There soft and supple always! I prefer the original pot over all the other Carmex, not only is it on my bedside table but in my purse, its always with me! Ive three daughters that use it before going to sleep at night, and it is with them everyday of the year also! All I can say is that it is simply the best lip product ever!!! I recommend it always when someone has chapped or dry lips or just want smooth soft lips always!;5.0;2551;290
2552;Lucky;You dont know how lucky you are to have carmex lip balm in a jar..... I came to Texas from miles away to find lips here are spoiled every day. They are being moistened with a balm that makes my red and inflamed lips, super calm. Plesant aroma that is second to none, and pretty soon you will have yours all gone. Not to fear tho carmex lip balm in a jar, cuz everyone here knows who you are! Just ask and you will see who has that balm takes only seconds and its in YOUR lucky little palm! I love carmex lip balm, never fails to heal my lips and keep them soft and moist!!!;5.0;2552;290
2553;Helping Lips Heal - Healthy Happy!;This is the ONLY product that heals cold sores completely! I had never had a cold sore before, but a few weeks ago, there it was. I went to the pharmacy and bought an expensive medicine specifically for cold sores. Not only did it not work, but actually made my lips itchy. As I have been using Carmex for years for my dry and chapped lips, I thought, okay, Ill give it a try on this cold sore! Like magic, its gone! This is a phenomenal product, and I am super grateful to the people at Carmex for consistently making high quality products. From my lips I say, THANK YOU!;5.0;2553;290
2554;Super Restorative;I found this product back in the 1980s. I walked into my local drug store looking for something that would work better on chapped lips fever blisters. My go to was Chap Stick before finding Carmex. I found Carmex to be so soothing restorative for my lips. I use it under lipstick or by itself everyday. For me, it keeps fever blisters manageable if I get one. Super moisturizing in any weather. I never leave home without one form of it in my pocket or handbag. This lip balm jar is my go to now before bed. Please never change your product, it works it works well!!;5.0;2554;290
2555;I always wondered why...;My sisters used to use this all the time! They ran through jar upon jar of it as I was growing up! Considering I was a good 10 years younger than them, I just thought they were weird teenagers, but when I turned 14, I was on the swim team at school, and the other girls were using it for their chapped lips, we had horribly dry lips due to the constant lap swimming we did in all weather 4 times a week, and after 3 days we had amazing lips! This stuff is the real deal! The girls who didnt use Carmex were looking a little raw faced at our trials, we used it even on our cheeks to help with windburn, and it was phenomenal for elbows too! It really does work for everything, and now I know why we had so many empty tiny yellow jars everywhere!;5.0;2555;290
2556;Superb probuct;After many years of using various other lip balms, discovering Carmex was a game changer. I will never use another lip balm.;5.0;2556;290
2557;Not the same as the original...;When I bought the new carmex thats in a pkg, rather than how they used to sell it in an open box..I noticed that it went up in price. Not a big deal, since that happens with time, everything seems to go up. But what I was upset about was that, even though it looks like the same jar, if you look underneath, the indentation goes up so far, that it is about half of what you used to get. I have an old glass jar, and compared to the new plastic one, the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up! Now Ive noticed the ones that are not in pkgs, have a tight plastic sticker on the bottom to cover up that fact. I havent bought any carmex since. I was going to email the company, but they sent me an email to review their product.;3.0;2557;290
2558;Nothing but the best.;I have been using this for at least 3 and a half decades. and love it to death, my only complaint is that I actually miss the old glass containers it came in. Fortunately I still have one, and often fill it up with the contents from the new plastic container. while I know it is the same stuff as before, I really miss the white glass containers it came in. even though I know the new plastic containers are safer, I still like the nostalgia of those glass containers.;5.0;2558;290
2559;Product is Wonderful;Great Product better then Abreva, price is fair better then most products;3.0;2559;290
2560;You cannot go wrong with this!;Let me first start by saying that I have suffered from severe chapped lips for as long as I can remember. I literally layers of skin peeling off from my lips little by little. Suffice to say, it can be quite painful. While I visited my doctor, I brought up my issue and he commanded Carmex. I was a bit skeptical but I went for it anyways. I have tried so many remedies before to no avail...so why not another attempt...Well, let me tell you this is my very last attempt because Carmex has improved my condition tremendously. It is not only soothing and moisturizing but helped with the peeling and the chapped lips. Now my lips are baby soft, supple and stays hydrated for long hours. I could not ask for a better lip balm!;5.0;2560;290
2561;Wonder balm!!;My wife bought this cream a few month ago and to be honest I was under the impression that it would be like all the other balms. Oh boy was I wrong! This little wonder balm is the cure to my chapped limps and the cure to my cold sores. YES cold sores. In fact it beats all other cold sore medication out there. When I use regularly, meaning I dont lose my jar like I often do, it prevents chapped lips and cold sores from reappearing. Plus I love the tingling sensation you get after you apply it. I recommend it to all my friends. Now that I found this product, my pharmacy does not carry it anymore. Now I have to find another place to get it! With the help of the website I think I found a solution. Thank you CARMEX.;5.0;2561;290
2562;MY FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD;Ever since I was little I have used carmex as my go-to chapstick. I love everything about it and I could never find a better lip balm. Its not just something to put on your lips when your lips are dry it also works wonders if your lips are cracked or hurting from being too dry. This product is a must have in your purse at all times! LOVE LOVE!!!!;5.0;2562;290
2563;The Original Smooth;I purchased this delightful little jar approximately two weeks ago, in preparation for the impending winter months, and the inevitably chapped and cracked lips. In the vast world we all live in today, we are often overwhelmed by the HUGE number of choices we are faced with every day, even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase. I cant thank Carmex enough for forever making this little choice easier for me by creating a lip balm that is by and far above the rest. Their simple yet elegant design combined with their no nonsense, get the job done formula make this the obvious choice for anyone looking to have healthy, happy lips throughout the holiday season.;5.0;2563;290
2564;Unlike any other lip remedy!;My lips are almost ALWAYS chapped without Carmex. Ive had dry and chapped lips for so long and Ive tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an instinctual urge and I dont think Ive ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. Theyre so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. Ive found with Lucas Pawpaw, its only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesnt absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. Ive only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me. I really love my little tub of Carmex and its by far one of the best lip remedies Ive picked up - at such an affordable price as well!;5.0;2564;290
2565;CARMEX LIPBALM;I was introduced to this product back in the 80s and this is yet by far the BEST product that I have used and will ever use. It keeps my lips moist and supple. I go out of my way when my pharmacy that I shop does not have my product. However I have learned now for years is to STOCK up, and that is exactly what I do. Thanks to CARMEX for this unique and exquisite product. Id love to be entered into a commercial if youd allow me. (SMILE)! I recommend this to all I encounter. Lastly, you have gotten a bit expensive and really there was no need. People who have used your product know QUALITY, but I think your prices are getting a bit profuse, Nonetheless I do stand by you 120;5.0;2565;290
2566;Great product;Excellent for dry cracked lips. Great product. Love it.;5.0;2566;290
2567;Since 1979;I started using carmex when I moved back home to Chicago in 1979. A co-worker at the Hospital turned me onto Carmex. She told me it was a staple for Winters in Chicago. I have used it ever since and I live in the Southeast now. Its not just good for sore chapped winter lips its perfect for surfing, a lipstick base or gloss, or just dry lips. Believe me, just ask my Hubby, I have jars in all my cars and my purses and stashed everywhere so its always handy. Ive traveled the World with my Original Carmex in the jar. Carmex has been with me to Mexico, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and all over the USA. I turn everyone on to Carmex that I spark conversation with while traveling !;5.0;2567;290
2568;Familiar Friend;My mom would always keep this jar of Carmex stocked in our bathrooms and nothing else was used in our house. Well, I am all grown up now and I had run out of my beloved Carmex in a jar. Hubby came home with some other brand that was immediately thrown in the trash. He obviously did not understand my love for the familiar soothing scent, the way it immediately took care of my dry lips and the yellow cover with the white pot. I found it in the store. Picked up five.Checked out, in the car, tore into one of those wrappers, opened one of those pots and that familiar friend was back!! My chapped lips were slathered with the soothing lip balm once again!;5.0;2568;290
2569;Raccoon Lips;Beginning in about 3rd grade, (approx 1978) every fall I would be cursed w/ a HUGE reddish/purple ring around my mouth from having SEVERELY dry lips literally using my upper lower lips as my chap aid! Spending the afternoon w/ my grandmother, she stopped at a local pharmacy to buy me a tube of ChapStick the pharmacist helping her suggested that we try a new aid handed her a little yellow tin tub of Carmex suggested we try it! I used it non-stop for the next few days, and AMAZED my whole family w/ how well FAST Carmex did the job!!!!! I have used NOTHING ELSE ever since! My lips belong SOLELY to Carmex!!!!! MANY Thanks Carmex!;5.0;2569;290
2570;MAKES THE WORLDS SOFTEST LIPS!!!;I have been an avid user of Carmex in the pot for the last 40 years!! I was living in Wisconsin when I started using this product in high school in the 70s. I then moved to Florida and they did NOT have Carmex in the state of Florida. I was distraught and had to have my mother send me shipments of carmex so I could survive. I have a pot of carmex in every room of my house, my car, my purses -- EVERYWHERE!!! I have tried all of the other lip products out there and the ONLY one I find absolutely reliable everytime is Carmex. My lips have stayed so soft for so many years and I never have chapped lips. Carmex is the best thing since sliced bread!;5.0;2570;290
2571;Always comes through for me!;I have used Carmex Original Lip Balm, in the little round jar, for many years and it has always come through for me! There are not many products out there, that I have found, that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do, but this one does. At the first hint of a cold sore, I grab the Carmex as quickly as I can. and apply it. It stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out. If I cant find my little jar, I panic and hurry to the store to buy another one. (No one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore!) Ive always thought it amazing that a product that works so well, would be so affordable!;5.0;2571;290
2572;Silky texture and smoothest effect.;I got my Carmex the first time I started having really chapped lips and it works wonder when taking this acne medication called Roaccutane which causes lips to be dehydrated. The orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days, I also used the original jar but right now I dont remember where I put it so I havent used it. From what I remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness.;4.0;2572;290
2573;Amazing;So I recently moved from Pennsylvania to Colorado. Huge elevation difference. A few days ago, a friend and I went to Garden of the Gods and I failed to bring chapstick. The result was me linking my lips WAY too much and I suffered tremendously the next day. My lips were on fire. The day after that, my lips were SO severely chapeed, I didnt even want to go to work. Well, of course I went, and I bought this little miracle in a jar. Within just a few hours, my lips were 80 better. Still chapped as they needed to heal but I was so shocked at how quickly Carmex soothed my lips. Amazing. I love it.;5.0;2573;290
2574;Classic Carmex;I love this product!!!!!!!!! I would definitely recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;5.0;2574;290
2575;What a nice surprise!;Somehow I found this balm in Romania, in a little store. I decided to buy it, the jar was so interesting, the price was good, too, but I must admit, my expectations werent very high. I have a lot of lip balms, and none of them really works. And then... such a big surprise! The menthol, the camphor... these arent very usual for lip balms, but they did a good job with my lips, together with the other ingredients. It became my favourite balm in the world! I would be sooo happy to try the other products, but, unfortunately, its impossible to buy these from here, and to bring them from the USA its too expensive.;5.0;2575;290
2576;I Love it - Cant Live Without It !!!;I buy these tubs by the dozen at a time. I use my Carmex 24/7 and carry it with me wherever I go. Cant leave home without My Carmex !!! Product works wonders at keeping my lips from chapping and keeps my lips supple and soft. Thank You Carmex - and yes in my picture.. my Carmex is in my coat pocket !!!;5.0;2576;290
2577;OMG! best lip balm ever!;I am in love with this lip balm. the original pot version. i love the way it makes my lips feel. it makes them feel fresh, smooth, soft. This is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips. other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy, this doesnt. its like a miracle in a jar. i never get cold sores, but i use this like an everyday lip balm. it is wonderful. if you like wearing lipstick, and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips, put some of this on your lips while your getting ready, then wipe it of and apply lipstick. i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar. carmex has the perfect texture. the smell is like the original chapstick smell. lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby dolls skin. kind of powdery in a way, but i like it. its so cheap. only 99 cents at my walmart. so worth buying. you wont be disappointed. you can also use it on dry hands as well. its long lasting too.;5.0;2577;290
2578;The BEST;I bought this and its always working the best on my lips. I love that when I wipe it off my lips are soft with no cracks and it helps with all my sores. This product is The BEST;5.0;2578;290
2579;Example: Great features;I bought this like a month ago and recommendations wasnt as well;1.0;2579;290
2580;I would not use anything else, but...;I have been using Carmex since the 80s when my mother introduced me to it. I in turn introduced it to my husband, he cannot do without it. Due to his addiction we probably keep 10 -15 jars stashed around the house and in the cars. One on each side of the bed, one in the bathroom, one in each of our cars. There is always at least 1 in the laundry room (freshly laundered) 2-3 in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones, just in case. My only disappointment was the day I went to buy an new jar and the package felt different... My beloved jar was now plastic. My little wonderfully feeling porcelain (I believe) jar was gone, I have to admit, that month I searched for my beloved jar in every store I went, in the hopes that they had not sold out of them, only to be replaced by the new plastic jar. I dont know about anyone else, but I would gladly pay an uncharge to have my beloved and true Classic Original Jar back once again.;5.0;2580;290
2581;Good one;Im happy with this product!Works well especially on dry lips;5.0;2581;290
2582;IT WORKS WONDERS!!!;I used to use the Cherry Chapstick from the brand Chapstick and their Cakebatter flavored one as well, but I stuggled with them in combination (one would work or the other would but neither were helping me). So eventually I searched for something new to help relive my dry almost papery lips, I tried the Original Carmex and I was in love after the first two days! I put it on as soon as I got it and slept with it overnight, when I woke up it was like my lips were never damaged!! I love Carmex and thank you so much!;5.0;2582;290
2583;Amazing product!;I have bought this lip balm few days ago, never heard of it before. Best product ever! Fell in love with it immediately.;5.0;2583;290
2584;Please NEVER stop making Carmex!;Carmex delivers like no other lip balm. Hands down best product!;5.0;2584;290
2585;Using it before I could spell it!;I have been using Carmex Original Lip Balm in the jar since I was a child. I remember my Mom getting out the little tub of Carmex putting on my lips before I went out the door, winter, spring, summer, or fall. When I was a teen there would always be a little jar in my Christmas stocking along with a tube now that I wanted to wear lip gloss. I never went to lip gloss, just my Carmex. As my own daughters came I would put a little Carmex on their lips before they left the house too...they got a little tub in their Christmas stockings. Now I have granddaughters who get a little Carmex on their lips before they go out from me their Moms! They also get a little jar flavored tubes in their Christmas stockings... all these years later at 60 yrs old its still my go to lip quencher season after season a Christmas stocking favorite!;5.0;2585;290
2586;Service in a combat zone;It was in Annasiriya, Iraq That I was introduced to Carmex and have been a true believer ever since. We were pulling security at the Ziggurat of UR while the Iraqis had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance. We were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day I had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip. A fellow soldier suggested Carmex. I was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns. Since that time, May 2003, I returned to southern Iraq in 2009 and spent January 2011 to February 2013 in Kandahar Province Afghanistan, and every time I took a good supply of Carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area.I told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some Carmex.;5.0;2586;290
2587;Long Lasting;My friend bought it for me and it feels good on the lips.;5.0;2587;290
2588;Lifelong favorite;My grandfather and father both used this product. Ive used it my whole life. It not only is a multipurpose product,but it brings me back and remind she me of my loved ones. I love Carmex, especially the jar- please dont go anywhere- ever!;5.0;2588;290
2589;Carmex Yellow Capped Jars A Wisconsin Tradition!;Im from a generation of Wisconsin families who have had Carmex Original Lip Balm Jars faithfully in their pocket, purse, backpack, and bathroom for over 40 years. From harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun, along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between, Carmex has relieved it all. From the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened, to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you, and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application...its happiness to my senses! I use it instead of lipstick for a natural shine several times throughout the day, and at night before bedtime to avoid chapped/dry lips. The Carmex Original Lip Balm Jar will continue to be one of my Wisconsin traditions that Ill highly recommend to my family and friends!;5.0;2589;290
2590;A Must Have!;I have always gotten horrific fever blisters and tried everything to soothe them - if youre not aware, they are very painful - anyways, a friend of mine asked me if I had ever tried Carmex and I hadnt and had honestly given up hope that anything would ever work. So, I was out at my local drug store and seen the Carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort - boy, was I so glad that I did! Carmex has been a life saver for me. I know that sounds shallow, but its the truth. I felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the Carmex soothed them. Needless to say, I have jars and tubes of Carmex every where in my house, car, purses, etc. You can never have enough. I use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected. Thank you for such a wonderful product, Carmex!;5.0;2590;290
2591;Helps so much;Carmex is my favorite lip balm ever. It always helps my chapped lips. I love it;5.0;2591;290
2592;Its great;Its great i love using it, but I suggest you guys make a bigger Jar or a Family sized jar so it can last longer.;5.0;2592;290
2593;Bless you;My lips always keep super dry during the winter regardless of how much water I drink. Ive gone THREE DAYS with chap, awful lips and finally remembered to pick up Carmex. It never lets me down. Im sitting here now with soft, soothed lips and it reminds me of how when youre super sick as a child and your mom comforts you. Normal chapstick never does the job. If people taking the time to write reviews about a lip balm tells you something, its something positive.;5.0;2593;290
2594;A Classic To Keep!;I remember when I first was introduced to Carmex, my mother put it on our chapped lips in the winter. I remember the tingling feeling on my lips and I loved it. I still use it today, and when friends ask me what do I use, instead of the usual chapstick or whatever else most people use, I always say Carmex because it works well. Its actually the only lipcare that I use--also perfect as a base before I put on lipstick. It just absolutely works. Thats it. A lot of other brands work for an hour or few, but with Carmex your lips stay moisturized well, and helps to prevent cold sores, although I dont get them, its nice to know that it also will care for them. Not only fo rthe cooler months, but all seasons, especially when winter comes, Carmex it is!;5.0;2594;290

2657;Wonderful;I swear by this stuff it is so good and work excellent on my lips������������������������ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.];;2657;290
2658;Soothing;I love Carmex brand. The original lip balm jar is the best! I use it every night before bed and my lips are incredibly soft in the morning. When I have a stuffy nose I put a tiny bit under it and it helps clear it up.;;2658;290
2659;Fast acting healer!;I use this for every facial issue from dry chapped lips, cold sore prevention, and event zit zapping! This is a must have product in every purse and on every trip!;;2659;290
2660;Amazing;So I recently moved from Pennsylvania to Colorado. Huge elevation difference. A few days ago, a friend and I went to Garden of the Gods and I failed to bring chapstick. The result was me linking my lips WAY too much and I suffered tremendously the next day. My lips were on fire. The day after that, my lips were SO severely chapeed, I didnt even want to go to work. Well, of course I went, and I bought this little miracle in a jar. Within just a few hours, my lips were 80% better. Still chapped as they needed to heal but I was so shocked at how quickly Carmex soothed my lips. Amazing. I love it.;;2573;290
2661;;I am so happy with Carmex, I love to do hand quilting my finger tips get sore. One night I put Carmex in the car on the fingertips the next morning they were soft and not SORE. I have been telling all my fellow quilters about this amazing product. Love It;;2661;290
2662;Super magical results!;This product is awesome! My nose and lips were raw from a nasty cold. Carmex soothed and healed this severe chapped skin in seconds! I was looking for a product with the healing product of lanolin and was pleased to find it is the second main ingredient! Thanks to carmex Im back to feeling great!;;2549;290
2663;great texture;Ive been using carmex now I dont use anything else its much better than blistex;;2399;290
2664;great look and feel;My favorite lip product for years. I always keep multiples around the house and in my car.;;2335;290
2665;Helped me dance better;It made my feet move faster and glide smoother. I couldnt have done it without Carmex lip balm!;;2665;290
2666;Cant live without it;Moved to Colorado from Southern California. Carmex is the only brand that has worked for my family here and dry cracked lips;;2666;290
2667;free for review;i like the smooth feeling carmex gives it has a light smell it makes my lips soft and chap free [This review was collected as part of a promotion.];;2667;290
2668;Silky texture and smoothest effect.;I got my Carmex the first time I started having really chapped lips and it works wonder when taking this acne medication called Roaccutane which causes lips to be dehydrated. The orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days, I also used the original jar but right now I dont remember where I put it so I havent used it. From what I remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness.;;2572;290
2669;The fair price it;I have used the chap stuck in the little round tube what I am useing right now to the orignal in th long tube this is te only thing that works on my chapped, dry, cold, soars, and sunburned lips. I also love the fact that it is very easy to apply and affordable.;;2669;290
2670;The ultimate lip care product.;Ive tried countless lip care products from countless brands across different price points, and nothing beats the Carmex Original Jar. It instantly soothes dry lips and regular application helps keep your lips looking and feeling great.This formulation is great to use year-round as its emollient both in colder and hotter weather.Do yourself a favor and apply as liberally and as often as possible. You wont regret it.;;2544;290
2671;Love it.;I have been using Carmex for about 10 years and I cant find anything better. Always have it in my pocket. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.];;2671;290
2672;Using it before I could spell it!;I have been using Carmex Original Lip Balm in the jar since I was a child. I remember my Mom getting out the little tub of Carmex & putting on my lips before I went out the door, winter, spring, summer, or fall. When I was a teen there would always be a little jar in my Christmas stocking along with a tube now that I wanted to wear lip gloss. I never went to lip gloss, just my Carmex. As my own daughters came I would put a little Carmex on their lips before they left the house too...they got a little tub in their Christmas stockings. Now I have granddaughters who get a little Carmex on their lips before they go out from me & their Moms! They also get a little jar & flavored tubes in their Christmas stockings... all these years later at 60 yrs old its still my go to lip quencher season after season & a Christmas stocking favorite!;;2585;290
2673;Does not color oil red;A good Chorizo should color your cooking oil red when fried in a pan. This Chorizo does not. Don Quijote is much better but more expensive and getting harder to find. What a shame that we cannot buy a good Chorizo here in the United States anymore.;3.0;2673;291

2675;Finally made a red wine reduction;Ive been dreaming of making a red wine reduction for years, finally did it for valentines for my then boyfriend, it was a hit (too bad he wasnt worth all that effort in the end). Regardless, it was a perfect meal and this stuff helped make it so.;5.0;2675;292

2681;Great source for an old favorite;Wonderful. We moved to a small town and I could no longer buy Goya cooking wines locally. Love the wine for cooking and the larger bottles are far more affordable than buying multiple smaller bottles of other brands. Wish I had thought of Amazon months ago!;5.0;2681;292

2683;Herring fillets in glass jar;This item is available in the Mt Prospect, IL store it is not out of stock. The fillets are extra firm and do not fall apart like some other varieties I have bought. I like the flavor of the fillets. I have bought the Bar Harbor fillets in wine sauce and did not care them.;5.0;2683;294
2684;Excellent yeast, not fussy at all;Nice fresh yeast. This brand has always performed exceptionally, and we have never had a dud. It doesnt impart harsh yeasty flavors to your fermentables. We have used this for wine and mead, holds up to higher alcohol, we dont even prime it, we just pitch and the airlocks are bubbling merrily away in a few hours.;;1612;295
2685;Great for most red wines;I have been making homemade wine for about eight years and have used the Red Star Pasteur Red Dried Wine Yeast on a number of occasions. I have had excellent results when using this for Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Fermentation has always started quickly and the yeast works fast to produce an alcohol content of somewhere in the 13 range. Moreover, it has worked excellently even when the room temperature hasnt been ideal for making wine. There is no yeasty taste after fermentation. I highly recommend this for full-bodied red wines.;;703;295
2686;Better yeast for red wine;I used this after using Montrachet which had a horrible sulfur smell while fermenting. Much happier with this so far.;;2686;295
2687;Great Product, Very Viable, Good Dry Flavor;Made a ginger champagne with this yeast and a few batches of mead. The mead and champagne were both dry and had great flavor (the champagne was super dry). I bought the ten pack over a year and a half ago and it is still viable, I always test this dry yeast in a small bottle with sugar water before I add any to my mead and it has and still is to this day viable yeast. Great product!!;;2687;295
2688;Elderberry Wine;The package states that the yeast is sufficient for 5 gallons, but Im only doing a gallon at a time. Im also using it for elderberries not grapes. Start to finish is about 8-10 days and the alcohol content is on the mark.;;2688;295
2689;Four Stars;Found some better yeast at a local brew shop. Ill probably buy that next time.;;700;295
2690;Good fruit wine yeast.;This is the only yeast I use for all fruit wines. As long as I get the recipe right, this yeast will work.;;2690;295
2691;Packs a Punch;I was not able to gage the alcohol content but I can say that it packs a punch. I would say that at the least it is 14-15. In fact, I gave my mom a bottle, she has to mix it with a lower content alcohol (9), and it still knocks her out with one glass. I gave a bottle to another friend and she said that she was ready to sleep after a glass. I did cherries, added raisins clove and 1 cinnamon stick and let it ferment for 4 weeks then removed the fruit and let it set in the fermenter another 3-4 weeks. I will definitely use this again!;;1608;295
2692;Great Product, Very Viable, Good Dry Flavor;Made a ginger champagne with this yeast and a few batches of mead. The mead and champagne were both dry and had great flavor (the champagne was super dry). I bought the ten pack over a year and a half ago and it is still viable, I always test this dry yeast in a small bottle with sugar water before I add any to my mead and it has and still is to this day viable yeast.

2698;My present to me!;Bought this red wine. For me! My holiday present! I love the crush version of Apothics red blend. Super flavor. It was less expensive to have 6 bottles shipped to me then to buy them at the local store.;5.0;2698;297
2699;Great Wine;Very nice wine - a little lighter than there other reds.;5.0;2699;297
2700;It is so good!! I got a buzz after one glass;It is a not dry... Very smooth, so you can taste the berry and cherry very well. Says it has communion and caramel in it but I couldnt taste either. It is so good!! I got a buzz after one glass. It is 14.5, so if you drink slow, you should be fine. I do not care for too sweet or dry. This makes this blend perfect!;5.0;700;297
2701;Best red wine!;I have been drinking this Apothic California Crush for the past six months and find it totally refreshing. It is so smooth and flavorable. One bottle is usually not enough and I tend to buy six bottles at a time. Fortunately the price in Alaska is much cheaper which makes it even more desirable!;1.0;2701;297
2702;Alright But....;This ointment works fine for dry eye. My only downfall is that it has a metal tip applicator. If it were plastic like the other similar products then I would give it 5 stars.;3.0;276;298
2703;Very good horseradish mustard;I stumbled across this a few years ago, and now its all we use when we can buy it. Great on hot dogs, brats, and the like. Its great to find out that we can order for store pick-up at Walmart. We would highly recommend to anyone that likes a little more kick than normal yellow mustard. To be clear, it is not too spicy at all. We think it is outstanding.;5.0;2703;299

2707;FANTASTIC;I brought the rose and cab. I just opened the rose and it was just as advertised - not too sweet. Thats the reason I dont drink roses they are either too dry or too sweet, however, this was mildly sweet and not dry at all and VERY SMOOTH. GETTING READY TO DO AUTO SHIP. Im a wine snob and yet I would serve this to a group and my personal wine connoisseur.;5.0;2707;300
2708;Incredible wines;I purchased the 12 Bottle Harvest Collection several weeks ago at the insane low price of $99.00!! I tried the Pinot Noir last night and it was fantastic!! I am looking forward to giving most away as gifts for the upcoming holiday season. You cannot go wrong with these wines! Have a great day everyone!!;5.0;2708;301
2709;I have unclouded fruit/veggie wines!;I had my doubts when I purchased this stuff, and confess to only buying it to be able to follow a recipe verbatim. But I am very impressed. I made a carrot wine, and decided to use a juicer instead of slicing and soaking in sugar to extract the juices. Using a juicer also extracts the pectin. I was going to deal with a cloudy wine since itll taste the same anyway. I added a teaspoon of this Pectic Enzyme to every gallon of my mash, and to my surprise, it worked! I had a very thick and cloudy wine after the first racking, but now that the wine has had its second racking and has been fermenting for nearly three months, it is a beautiful clear orange color, with no cloudy qualities to note! Now that Im a believer, I use it in all of my white or lighter colored wines, and no matter the extraction method I use, Im getting a nice, clear wine a few months later.;;2709;302
2710;Pectic Enzyme;Use this in clearing wine and light fruit beverages. Replacing an itemdifficult to find locally. Works as it should....very satisfactory...;;2710;302
2711;Reasonable Value;Has worked wonders when using fresh fruit. I usually add a little more than the package says to speed things along, but I dont notice a taste or texture difference, even when adding extra later in the process for homebrew. Can be sticky when wet so best poured in with a dry funnel.;;2711;302
2712;I use this to break down fruit;Its just another product youd want to use when you need to break down the fruit for fermentation. If that is your goal, then this is what you need.;;2712;302
2713;Great value;This is a great value ,it was the cheapest I found it anywhere. It worked great for my home made wines.;;2713;302

2722;Very happy;Ive purchased Barefoot Cellars many times and this sampler was a great buy! The price was perfect and getting a chance to sample a little bit of everything is even better. My package came boxed very well and in my set I received a bottle of Pinot Grigio Champagne (saving for special occasion). I had a glass of the Chardonnay last night with dinner and it was so refreshing. Ive had a variety of whites and have tried to find something that I could have with a nice meal or alone (I am not a fan of white wines), but this one was perfect! Definitely could have a glass of this alone while reading a good book.;5.0;2722;304
2723;Christmas Made Easy...;Getting Christmas presents to friends and family in the USA (from the UK) can be frustrating. Established gift companies often charge over the odds for the items they sell, but this Barefoot Cellars Sampler Case is great value (and were told that it tasted great).

2738;not the best;I have purchased this wine with various cheaper brands and have liked it FAR more. Seemed very sour to me. Not mellow at all.

Will go to the local state store for my regular brand.;1.0;2738;306

2740;Worth Exactly What I Paid...;This wine is not great, in my opinion. I know wine taste is subjective, and this is only my opinion. But to me the wines are harsh, not smooth. An $8 taste, not $20 like hosts claimed. Ill drink it, will not gift it as I had hoped to, and have cancelled my auto delivery. I bought the mixed box so Ive tried them all...;3.0;2740;307
2741;Found To Be Poor;Wish this could be a positive review but not this time.Found the reds to be lacking greatly in aroma (nose) and both with an unpleasant finish.Usually we have been pleased overall with the wines but this is a definite miss for us.;1.0;2741;307
2742;Ok, but not what I was looking for.;It my quest to find an equivalent to Stoneys Ginger Beer that is only available in South Africa, this wasnt exactly what I was searching for, but wasnt bad. It didnt make a whole lot either, which was a bummer. Given the trouble of having to by carbonated water and mix it up, I would probably go with another option.;;2742;308
2743;Moscow Mule;Bought this to make Moscow Mules and and following the directions on the bottle for mules, it made great ones. Suggest that you fizz it up with bubble water.;;2743;308
2744;Delicious!;I love this stuff! So versatile - great for tea, hot wing sauce, salad dressing ingredient and what its supposed to be used for - ginger beer. You can even mix that up a bit, too -- I use flavored La Croix soda water (lime, lemon, grapefruit) and thats great too. They label this medium spicy - Id love to see a spicier version.The great thing about this syrup is that you can make your ginger beer as sweet or as dry as youd like. I bought this originally as a one-time purchase, but next time Ill be a subscribed purchaser. Its a must have for me.;;2744;308

2759;Decent wines that help out some great causes!;I have tried the Cabernet and the Merlot. When I received these I followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping, and then to open and let sit in order to breathe. I felt the Cabernet was still to young, it had a very strong bite to it. I dont consider myself an expert, but I know a wine I like and have been taught a lot and am still learning. The Merlot on the other hand was much better! It was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins. I would continue buying this one. I have not tried the Pinot Noir yet. Im hoping this will be just as satisfying as the Merlot was. I will add to my review once Ive opened the bottle. And most of all I love how this company takes some of the proceeds and gives them to wonderful causes. That alone is worth buying this!;4.0;2759;310

The company is all about sustainability and giving back. One Hope is a company with a cause, AND outstanding wine. There is just so much to love about this wine!;5.0;700;310

2766;Disappointing. Sweet!;I almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines. We pretty much couldnt even drink them because they are so sweet, thick and jammy. Like fruit juice. We started with the Pinot Noir and after a few sips, aerating and then a few more sips with dinner, we just poured it out. It did not resemble any Pinot Ive had before. So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I havent tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned. Unfortunately, I thats not an option since they are open and mail order. Maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking. I do love that this producer gives back to charities, more companies should follow their lead in that respect.;2.0;2766;310
2767;A new favorite;Wine by mail! And such good, full-bodied reds. I will buy again.But along the way, I need a new corkscrew. My serviceable current one struggles with the tight-packed corks. Makes sense who wants leaky wine And re-corking is no cinch, either.I have wandered among the corkscrews sold on Amazon, and have no idea how to choose. If you have a suggrstion, please leave it in comments. Thanks!;5.0;2767;310
2768;LOVE LOVE LOVE this wine;LOVE LOVE LOVE this wine. My friend threw an event and used ONEHOPE and ever since I have been hooked. Bought the 3 pack as a thank you gift and it was a huge hit. Love the fact that this company donates 50 to good causes. Takes the guilt out of drinking, ha!;5.0;2768;310
2769;Fantastic wines supporting great causes;LOVE the new labels and also love knowing that with every sip, we are making a social impact. This is a great gift to send to family and friends... spreading the word about great wines and awesome causes they support!;5.0;2769;310

First purchase were given away as individual gifts. Decided to taste for my self. Im a pinot/cab fan. The pinot was a little on the light side for me but as someone mentioned earlier, open and let sit for a while. Its definitely better. The cab is my favorite and I would purchase again. I shared the merlot with a merlot fan and they liked it a lot. Since part of the proceeds go to various charities its worth the purchase.;4.0;2770;310
2771;One Hope is a Winner One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No;Arrived promptly and well packed. Nice selection of wines which tasted very good. Will be using this often as gifts. By going through Amazon Smile we can contribute to our designated Smile cause and also do some good through donations made by One Hope. Its a real win-win situation.;5.0;700;310

2773;One of my favorite big reds. Jammy, fruit forward, lush, berries. One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No;One of my favorite big reds. Jammy, fruit forward, lush, berries. Not too sweet (for our taste), tannic (in a good way). I alternate at the moment on a daily basis between Apothic Dark and Gnarly Head Authentic Black. Both selling for 6.99 at Ralphs. (Why would anyone buy online and pay double);4.0;2773;311
2774;Pleasant surprise! Very pleasant.;Wow! I wanted a different kind of wine to serve to friends. Unfortunately (for them) I opened the bottle of Apothic Dark before anyone arrived so I could taste it. By the time they showed up, there wasnt much of the Apothic left to share. Oops. They got the regular wine. This is now by far my favorite wine. By the way, if you like a sweet tickle pink kind of wine, this one is not for you.;5.0;2774;311
2775;it smelled like espresso at breakfast;I am not a fan of red wines. But I study nutrition and am learning about the health benefits of dark red wines. I got this at Trader Joes with fingers crossed. When I opened the bottle, it smelled like espresso at breakfast. I found that odd, but I love coffee, so it gave me hope that I would like it. Sipping this delicious beverage was like warm berries on a summer day. This wine is straight up comfort food. Sublimely satisfying;5.0;2775;311
2776;Five Stars;If you like blends, this is very good.;5.0;2776;311
2777;One of Our Favorites;This is currently one of our favorite wines! Weve even recommended it to friends. Its moderately sweet without to much dryness at the end. The cork is actually black, which we thought was a nice touch.;5.0;2777;311
2778;Deep Rich Excellent;Love this deep rich but not sweet wine. My first taste was few months ago while visiting relatives in Copperhill, Tennessee. I was surprised with the wonderful, smooth taste and flavors, and happy to learn it was a California wine. Upon returning to Calfornia I ordered a case and shared this delicious hearty smooth wine with friends. Apothic also makes a red wine that is not dark, it to is a smooth flavorful wine but not as rich and deep as the dark, it goes great with everything or nothing. Enjoy, Christina;5.0;2778;311
2779;Good Cabernet Sauvignon;Based on reading some of the reviews here, I considered canceling my order. Im very glad I did not! I just received my first shipment, and I have to say I am really enjoying this Cabernet Sauvignon. Im very glad I signed up for auto-ship!;4.0;2779;312
2780;Disappointing;I realize this is an inexpensive bottle of wine but it is tasteless. Will not buy wine from QVC again.;1.0;2780;312
2781;Great wine;This is one of the best Chards that I have had in a long time. Very light and delicious. I have ordered another wine from qvc and this is the best yet. I am on automated ordering and I also changed it to every 60 days. You will not be disappointed.;5.0;2781;312

2787;Decent;I have tried the cab and it is acceptable for what I wanted - an after work glass of wine. Put the Pinot away as it is way too young to drink. The rose was refreshing. I have not tried the Chardonnay yet. This group of wines worked for me in that 1) it was about the price of grocery store wine, 2) it was delivered to my house, and 3) I get to try a variety of wines that I normally would not purchase. I marked that I would not recommend this as a gift only because everyones palate is different - I do not usually give wine as a gift.;4.0;2787;315
2788;Great Wine for all food types or by itself!;I have been waiting for this bundle. As the presentation indicated the Rose is not that over bearing sweet, just in the middle and therefore I can enjoy it also, along with the delicious Pino Noir my favorite and the Chardonnay. These are delicious with a meal, by themselves or with cheese - as David says, everything is better with cheese.. I have on Auto- delivery. I wish I could pre-order for next year too.. Very Smooth wine. Everything they said in the presentation with David and other hosts are spot ON! I am enjoying this bundle and you will too.. Thank you QVC and Vintage Wine Estates. Sincerely,;5.0;2788;315
2789;WINES were TERRIBLE, QVC was GREAT!!;"I bought 2 of the wine collections; one in the mixed of white & red and one in the all reds. The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we arent even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. Im giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!! No hassles, questions, etc... just immediately refunded the 2 payments I already made. While the wines disappointed, QVC did not! Thank you QVC, this is exactly why I will remain a loyal shopper!!";2.0;2789;315
2790;Very disappointed;I consider myself a wine lover but I’m not a wine snob. I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites. After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case. You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Lessons learned in this case.;2.0;2790;315
2791;Disappointed;Got this for the nice variety it offered. Rose is nice, not too sweet not too dry. Pinot noir is average, nothing special or outstanding and I wouldn’t get it again. Chardonnay is awful— maybe just the bottle we opened, but it immediately smelled spoiled and tasted the same. Wound up pouring it down the drain and hoping the next two bottles aren’t rotten as well. Have not tried the Cab yet as it’s my favorite type of wine and I hate to be disappointed—hoping we’ll be two for four at least. Sorry to say next time I’ll pass...;3.0;2791;315
2792;Best purchase for the price;We are still sampling each one - so far favorite is the Chardonnay, but that can change;5.0;2792;315
2793;TASTY TASTY;I just received my collection. I opened the Rose and it was very tasty. This Rose is not overly sweet and that was my main concern. It has a light fruity taste and pairs well with cheeses. I havent tasted the others yet, but this is a great deal for the quantity you receive. I will continue to update as I open the others.;5.0;2793;315

2797;Decent but Handle is broken;I love the size and the price on this cooler. However the lower quality than brand name coolers is evident in the finish on this cooler.

2801;Meritage is perfect blend;I like full bodied but smooth red. The meritage is a perfect blend of the things I love in red wine. Have alternated lately between a Pinot noir and Cab. This is delicious and perfectly priced.;5.0;2801;319
2802;"3 cheers for ""Mr. Wonderful""";I knew that Kevin OLeary loved good wine. Well, let me tell you, he also makes some delicious wine. I purchased the 3-bottle Chardonnay and it is Wonderful. Im no wine expert, but I know what I like. I enjoy white wine but I dont like sweet, which is why I didnt try the Moscato. I like to enjoy a nice glass of white wine whenever I feel like it. This wine is delightful by the glass - no food necessary. Im very pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that I purchased it on auto-delivery. I cant wait for my next shipment! I highly recommend this wine. Mr. Wonderful will not let you down!;5.0;2802;319
2803;BEST RED!!!;I have ordered wines from OLeary before. I love red wine. But THIS red wine is AWESOME!!! More smooth than Cabernet, and Cab is usually my FIRST choice. That was OK but THIS THIS THIS one ... Auto Delivery for sure!!!!;5.0;2803;319
2804;Totally surprised!;Bought the wine for my son for a Christmas present. Was very skeptical at first. First, I myself really dont care for wine. Leaves a nasty after taste and bitter to me, plus after drinking 1 glass of red, I wake up with a severe headache. Well anyway my son open a bottle, I had ordered all red. I went over to see if I could with stand the smell. Totally surprised I could, so I decided to try it. Very smooth, no after taste. Not a strong, bitter smell. Had guests over for New Years eve and they had enjoyed it just as much as I did and my son. Probably will be ordering again.;5.0;2804;320
2805;Not so great blends;Disappointed with the taste and consistency of these wines. My husband and I were looking forward to sharing them with friends on Christmas Eve. We tried the four variety to be fair and were not satisfied planning to send the rest back.;1.0;2805;320
2806;Pleasantly Surprise;I too was skeptical on ordering wines on line. I figured Meh... I love wine how bad could it be..... I was surprised... Very Smooth, flavorful with a beautiful nose.;5.0;2806;320
2807;Pleasantly Surprised!;I was a little skeptical about purchasing wine from QVC, but Ive been very surprised by the quality of this wine collection. I ordered the mixed-auto delivery package. The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like youd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that Im a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin OLearys Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). Im so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I cant wait to see what I get in the Spring. Very good wine, Mr. OLeary.;5.0;2807;320
2808;Good wine;I belong to other clubs but bought this because of the free shipping. I do NOT like Rose wine and was sure Id hate it but.......it is excellent. A slight sweet taste very slight. It is a little effervescent too. I forgot where I bought it and googled it to buy more . It runs 75.00 for 3 bottles! Not expensive but not 5.00 a bottle either. I have not had the others but I am anxious to taste them....;4.0;2808;321
2809;Mediocre;You get what you pay for, I got it for $8.25 a bottle and thats about all it is worth. I should of known better. but its free s&h,. I was disappointed its all from the same vintner and not as the labels show different wineries. It was just the ease of delivery. I live in California and have so many options of good wines. One and only purchase. Q does not know good wines!;2.0;2809;321
2810;Our friends loved it!!!;We had four friends over tonight for dinner. They loved this wine! Hands down the Mascato was the favorite!

Great buy! Love this set!;5.0;2839;327
2840;Good value;I purchased two of these as holiday gifts. The price seemed just right for a bottle of wine, glasses and chocolate. In fact, even without glasses, this wouldve been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I cant speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated lets get naked referring Im sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that. I feel a bit embarrassed now as I hope the recipients dont confuse my intentions. Fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had I sent this to someone more conservative in my life, I would have been so very, very embarrassed.;5.0;2840;327

2842;Tastes like a 40+ Cabernet Sauvignon - Not an Oaky Fruit Bomb.;This wine is the best cab for the money Ive ever had. Sometimes a 10 cab tastes like a 20 cab, and thats a bargain wine for sure. This Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Naked Winery drinks like a 40+ cabernet. So try it now! This is not a fruity oak bomb, nor a lengthy, earthy, subtle cab.Here are my 2-liner tasting notes:Black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate. Medium tannins. An elegant, smoky barrel toast on the finish.;5.0;1531;327

I take it out of the refrigerator an hour before drinking it & its perfect. Its not to cold or warm. When drunk too cold, it doesnt have much taste. At the proper temp, it becomes much more complex. It has a clean delicate taste of peach & apricot. Its not a heavy chardonnay. No oak, butter or vanilla undertone. I prefer this crisper, fresher chardonnay. The heavy ones make me gag.;4.0;2853;328
2854;Great Moscato;Dont know why others have given such bad reviews. I guess each person has their own taste but I love the Moscato & my family & friends also enjoy it!;5.0;2854;328
2855;Disappointed;Im not a wine drinker but have relatives and friends who are, so I purchased 12 bottles to have on hand at home and also for gifts. My brother visited this weekend and I opened the red wine for him to enjoy during a football game. He tried to be gracious but finally said it just wasnt good. Now Im wondering what the people thought who received wine as gifts. I have eight bottles left and wondering if I should just pour them down the drain. What a disappointment after the hosts all ooo-ed and ahhh-ed over this supposedly fabulous wine assortment.;1.0;2855;329
2856;Great valued wine;I have order three cases over past two years a great wine for the price point. Other reviews I Have read judge this to harshly. Including shipping it is a twelve dollar a bottle wine, I have order many wines for an average of 18.00 a bottle and not nearly as good. . I order 15 cases of wine a least every year, this is a great value in the price range it sells for;5.0;2856;329
2857;Loved These Wines;I am not a wine expert, but I am Italian and like wine. I ordered the white selection and I absolutely love it. I enjoy a glass of wine without the meal attached. My first time ordering Moscato and it is delicious, next favorite is the White Zinfandel. The Chardonnay is also very good. Kevin did an excellent job mixing the favors. I am on auto-delivery so I am able to give them as nice gifts, but not the Moscato.;5.0;2857;329
2858;Love it not crazy for kevin;We ordered 12 white and 12 red twice, really like them. Sweet is not a favorite, but it was good.;5.0;2858;329
2859;Ill choose my own;"Thought this would be a good sampler of wine at a very decent price. The mixed case has some wine that friends liked, some I liked. But overall the case is just non descript. Chardonnay was very light on the oaky taste. Other whites were OK. Meritage is OK. Pinot Noir was unidentifiable as such. Cab Sauv. OK. White Zin? No one wanted it. So I cant say this was a ""wonderful"" assortment. I have cancelled the remainder of the auto ship. Thanks anyway, Kevin. Ill pick my own bottles locally.";2.0;2859;329
2860;Mediocre at best!;Not the quality at all that I was expecting from Kevin OLeary. Very disappointed, and I would not serve this to guests.;3.0;2860;329
2861;Its not worth the hassle;Definitely not worth the hassle, dont waste your time or your money;1.0;2861;329
2862;using for cooking wine;The cab was the only drinkable one. Using for cooking wine. For that reason, Mr Wonderful, Im out.;2.0;2862;329
2863;Better than expected;First, before I purchase a wine for a second time I need to sample it. Not possible this way of course so I relied on QVC and Kevin OLearys reputation for making my purchase.So far I have been very pleased with the quality and taste of each of the reds in the collection, a great value for the quality and proud to serve it to guests. Look forward to next auto-ship and purchasing the white collection.;5.0;2863;329
2864;ALWAYS A HIT!!;LOVE LOVE LOVE Kevins Reserve Wines. Just the best! 5th or 6th time ordering and will continue to order more and auto delivery. FANTASTIC deal on really great wine! Cant go wrong! A no brainer! If you love wine...DO IT!;5.0;2864;329
2865;Glad we purchased this wine;Had this wine for a few months and finally got around to tasting...we ordered the 12 bottle sampler set and we are loving the Chardonnay and the Syrah...cannot wait to taste the others...Will order again.;5.0;2865;330
2866;Not very good;Im not a wine snob but Ive had my fair share of wine over the years. I taste new brands fairly regularly. You can do much better at your local store for the same or less money. Basically tastes like a good box wine. Black Box ... etc.;2.0;2866;330
2867;Excellent value;The Cabernet is a true value. The Chardonnay is also great.;5.0;2867;330
2868;consistently smooth and delicious;We have ordered both white and red sets of OLeary wines more than once, and we have had consistently excellent wine with every single bottle.The sweet wines are delicate and blended perfectly without being too sweet. The rich reds are deep without being too tannic or biting. When we need a wine we can count on to be perfect for guests, or gifts or just enjoying with our everyday meals, this is our go-to wine.We recommend it highly.;5.0;2868;330
2869;Worst Ever;I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I’ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression “rot gut”.;1.0;2869;330
2870;Dont bother...;If youre a selective wine drinker, dont buy this. Its mediocre at best. Will likely end up using for cooking.;1.0;2870;330
2871;Barely average wine;I wish I had returned this wine, but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying. Have ordered Vintage Wine Estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed. OLerarys reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members. Not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what, but just no happy with these and would not order again. Kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable, but there is better wine available at lower cost.;2.0;2871;330
2872;Not Happy With Auto Delivery;"Purchased on auto delivery. First shipment great, second came with 6 bottle of sav but no moscato. We do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles. Third shipment came with the moscato and 3 more sav. Shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment. Moscato is great others are ok. Trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even ""included"" makes it costly. Disappointed.";2.0;2872;330
2873;Good mix;"Im really picky about wine. To be honest, Ive had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance. I actually really really liked the moscato. Moscato is my favorite type of wine and Ive had a lot that I dont care for. If you like Bartenura, you will appreciate this. I liked the white zin also. I didnt care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" Id like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. Id say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who havent heard of the bartenura comparison, its a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as OLeary. If youre curious about this, if say take a chance. Regardless how I feel about the taste of the chardonnay, they are all quite fragrant which I enjoy.";4.0;2873;330
2874;Not what I was hoping for;I purchased the 12 bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage. I usually drink Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. I wish the wines lived up to their descriptions, but sadly they did not. I realize tastes are subjective, but for me, the Chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste. I would not order these again..;2.0;2874;330
2875;Cab is good, Pinot is not;I am a Pinot Noir wine drinker generally, but the Pinot Noir in this case is terrible, even after decanting. Have tried two of the Pinot bottles and a few of each of the others. I actually prefer the Cab over anything in the case and I usually dont like cabs.;2.0;2875;330
2876;Worst Purchase I Have Ever Made!;Cant believe that I was so stupid to fall for Kevin OLearys promotion of his wines. I believed in him, and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety.dozen bottles. What a fool I have been! I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, but I continue to be disappointed. Yes, I know I have a month to return the merchandise! What a laugh!! How to return a huge package? I poured most in the kitchen sink... live and learn.;1.0;2876;330
2877;Worst Ever;I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I���ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression ���rot gut���.;1.0;2869;330
2878;fine wines;I am more of a dry wine person, but I have enjoyed the chardoney and rose. Not to sweet, not to dry. Great gifts my friends said they enjoyed;5.0;2878;330
2879;I EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR;"I was really hopeful that I would experience a new tasting wine just because its ""Mr. Wonderfuls"" brand. However it was not as flavorful as what I had become accustomed. Its not bad its just okay. I purchased the Zinfandel. I wanted the Moscato but it had sold out. I still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what Im looking to purchase. I would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting.";3.0;2879;331
2880;Not Very Good;I purchased the Pinot Noir and it was terrible. Dumping it and won’t purchase again .;1.0;2880;331
2881;Ordered More Than Once;I only like sweet (not super sweet) wine and the Moscato is absolutely delicious. Im not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings. Ill have it with anything because it tastes that good. Like it before, during, or after dinner. It just tastes great. This is really good wine and the price is good too.;5.0;2881;331
2882;Best Ever;This is the best vine I have ever tasted. I had to reorder me a second round.;5.0;2882;331
2883;Best purchase ever;Very unique tast,I love it you wont go wrong with this;5.0;2883;331
2884;Treat Yourself;I have ordered the set of 12 in the past. I have tried them all and enjoyed allHowever white zinfandel is my favorite. I have given them as gifts with no complaints just compliments. Soooo smooth;5.0;2884;331
2885;Excellent;I only like a sweet wine. I was skeptical on ordering without tasting it first. I am so glad I ordered it. I love it. THANKS KEVIN OLEARY!!!;5.0;2885;331
2886;Delicious !!;I ordered a 3 bottle set of both the Meritage & Moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines. They called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile !! Said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these 3 bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties !! Thanks Kevin & QVC for a hit !!;5.0;2886;331
2887;Sumptuous delicious wine.;I ordered the White Zinfadel in the 3 bottle selection which arrived on Friday. This wine is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. My husband and I visited Nappa Wine Valley and Sonoma Wineries about 3 years ago. Our hats off to Mr. Kevin OLeary to bring such a joy, a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold its own. We had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done. Thank you so much for this wonderful offering.;5.0;2887;331
2888;Excellent Moscato;This was my first purchase of these wines. Tried the Moscato as I like a sweet wine. Found it to be the best Ive ever had. The only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery. Missed the UPS guy a couple times.;5.0;2888;331
2889;OLearys Select Reserve Chardonnay;I dont know why the negative reviews said the wine tasted horrible..? I should have ordered a case! Mr. Wonderful, you have not promised what you havent delivered 10-fold with this wine! I ought to go on auto ship with the case!;5.0;2889;331
