Bold, Flavorful, Aromatic, Delicious;This is a phenomenal wine and my new favorite red.;5.0;2016-11-02T10:00:37.000Z;;3.0;2.0
Yum! Plus, Environmentally Friendly!;4 750ml bottles for the price of two With way less packaging YES PLEASE! I was nervous it was too good to be true and I wouldnt like the wine but its fantastic! I have to go a bit out of my way to get it (I live near a state line and it isnt sold in my state due to liquor laws) but its worth it.;5.0;2014-11-25T03:37:34.000Z;;4.0;3.0
Great Taste;I LOVE Becks NA. It tastes just like a regular ale. It smells like one too. It tastes great. Its the only NA that I drink. My friends love it too. It has a great head when you pour.;5.0;2017-09-04T04:35:11.000Z;;5.0;4.0

A Sweet Red.;I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a sweet red. Instead it gets poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Targets shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less.;2.0;2015-11-09T04:06:16.000Z;;7.0;5.0
;Delicious and very affordable;5.0;2017-09-20T13:13:29.000Z;;8.0;6.0
Charles & Charles Red Blend;This is a very smooth red with Aromas of cocoa, coffee, tobacco sweet black cherry. Bold but soft. I highly recommend this one.;5.0;2015-10-15T15:26:07.000Z;;9.0;7.0
This Wine Made My Party!;Based on positive reviews, I served all of the Fancy Pants varieties at a recent party. My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads. Served well chilled, our Sauvignon Blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics.;5.0;2015-04-11T20:59:32.000Z;;10.0;8.0
Nice Sparkling Wine Compared To Champagne;Nice fruity and sweet taking sparkling wine. Goes great in mimosa. You have to try it to see how you will like it. Even the guys would enjoy this at your wedding!;5.0;2011-12-22T03:52:36.000Z;;11.0;9.0
Great Nh Beer!;A rich amber Ale with a subtle but noticeable hop character. Great beer to pair with food!;5.0;2016-10-01T03:09:18.000Z;;12.0;10.0
Dry-Hopped Ipa!;This light bodied IPA is dry hopped with cascade for a bold and bright HP aroma, balanced by a refreshing and crisp Ale. Great for a cookout out day at the beach, love it!;5.0;2016-10-01T03:12:10.000Z;;12.0;11.0

Lovely! Try It!;Great for a perfect summer day or a get together with the girls.;5.0;2013-05-11T19:24:51.000Z;;15.0;12.0
Fizzy Pinot Grigio?;Im not sure if this is a bad bottle or if it was intentionally made effervescent. I dont want bubbles when I drink Pinot Grigio. Goes well with mozzarella string cheese and Cinemasins.;2.0;2017-09-13T01:54:31.000Z;;16.0;13.0
Obsessed;Obsessed with this new drink----However, it has been sold out at every Target I have been to lately :(;5.0;2016-12-08T17:55:50.000Z;;17.0;14.0
Great Wine;This is an excellent red wine, not to dry and not real sweet. More of a red blend. Great go with anything anytime. In the right price point as other known brands on the market.;5.0;2014-12-09T22:59:07.000Z;;18.0;15.0
Excellent Cab......!!!!!!!;One of the best Cabernets I had in quite sometime......!!!!!!;5.0;2016-01-27T15:47:00.000Z;;19.0;16.0
Highly Recommended;This is a great buy for the price. Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didnt want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. Its a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.;5.0;2017-11-24T21:17:46.000Z;;20.0;17.0
Michelob Ultra Light Cider;Gluten free plus lower on calories plus very refreshing!;5.0;2015-11-30T17:23:24.000Z;;21.0;18.0
Please Dont Discontinue This Flavor Combination!;Best of the bunch of all of The wine Cube skus. Target Wine Buyer: please bring back!;5.0;2016-05-18T07:15:02.000Z;;22.0;19.0
Wine Is Good - The Cube Is Not;I like the wine and I like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time. But when they re-sized the box a few months ago, it made it impossible to open and setup properly. While I applaud Target for reducing the packaging, this just isnt working.;3.0;2013-05-04T13:26:12.000Z;;23.0;20.0
Could Not Believe The Taste;I have tried my share of Moscato D Astis before, this has to be the smoothest that I have ever tried. Not too sweet or too fizzy but perfect. I got it for the pretty bottle but was very surprised about the taste. Try it, you wont be disappointed.;5.0;2013-12-31T22:02:31.000Z;;24.0;21.0
My New Fave!;Highly, highly recommend!! Its sweet but not syrupy- just right! And I love that its bubbly, I dont have to mix my wine with seltzer anymore!;5.0;2015-11-04T20:46:33.000Z;;25.0;22.0
;My favorite bottle design. The best cheap lager.;5.0;2017-11-07T21:38:55.000Z;;26.0;23.0

Who Can Say No To Awesome $5 Wine;This wine is amazing! Im an avid wine drinker (mom life) and Ill continue to buy this for sure. For 5 its a steal! Keep this around please, its just another reason to love target!;5.0;2017-09-10T00:53:11.000Z;;28.0;25.0

Yum!;Great fruity dry rose!;5.0;2017-02-25T01:16:55.000Z;;34.0;31.0
An Outstanding Table Wine;Is this the greatest wine in the world, of course not. It is an eminently drinkable wine,as a matter of fact it is my preferred, and go to, table wine. Wine is a personal thing but for me it is my 1 pick in the under 10 category. It is well balanced, subtle, and very easy to sip. Dry without being overpowering. It is not a big bad Cabernet but it is not that in a good way. Goes great by itself or paired with cheese or a dish sauced with something heavier like a bernaise. I always have a bottle on my shelf.;5.0;2015-11-04T03:14:21.000Z;;35.0;32.0

Vintners Red Boxed Wine;Picked some up on a trip to the beach as they are portable non breakable and priced right! I didnt know what to expect, honestly, my expectations were not too high, being boxed wine and all. I was pleasantly surprised! It is very drinkable delicious! When I got home I returned to Target to get the large wine cube box for at home enjoyment!;5.0;2015-04-08T06:50:22.000Z;;41.0;38.0
Great Sauvignon Blanc Even Compared To Medium-Priced Bottles;By far the best boxed wine Ive found, and comparable to medium-priced bottled sauvignon blancs. A great buy.;5.0;2013-08-17T16:07:16.000Z;;42.0;39.0

;Taste was absolutely fine for a 5 Chardonnay. However, BOTH bottles broke while removing the corkscrew. Second break was far enough I didnt want to risk drinking it because of risk of glass shards. Ive bought cheaper wines like yellowtail, etc, and NEVER experienced a bottle breaking.;2.0;2017-11-12T00:52:24.000Z;;44.0;40.0
Great Wine For The Price.;I didnt find this to be sweet at all, but everyones taste differs. I usually dont like sweet wines so I gravitate towards Chardonnay and some Sauvignon Blancs and I felt like this one had more of a buttery taste than a sweet citrusy taste like another reviewer stated. For the price, this is definitely a keeper.;4.0;2017-10-19T01:58:23.000Z;;45.0;40.0
Love It!;My boyfriend brought this home on a whim. We were delighted at how tasty it was. Lasted us a couple weeks - even better!;5.0;2016-10-22T02:08:27.000Z;;46.0;41.0
Delicious!;I love Disaronno. It has a smooth texture and the flavor is lightly sweet. Its decadent on the rocks or with a little cream.;4.0;2012-02-14T12:22:40.000Z;;47.0;42.0
Great For The Price;Im surprised how good this is for the price! Tastes more like Sauvignon blanc to me...;5.0;2015-10-10T05:00:45.000Z;;48.0;43.0
;Nice, light wine - I was not sure what to expect but was surprised how well it tasted for a 5 bottle.;5.0;2017-09-18T19:33:35.000Z;;49.0;44.0
Pretty Good For Wine In A Box!;For as much as we drink white wine, I needed to find a budget bottle. Wed been doing 6-7 dollar bottles, but this beats that. And its pretty good! You wont impress anyone with this, but for a Monday-Thursday, home and on a budget drinking, this is good.;4.0;2015-10-24T05:23:35.000Z;;50.0;45.0
This Wine Made My Party!;I served this and all the different varieties at a party. My guests and I loved them all. Since I am not a wine expert, I will simply give you some of the notes on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...a robust and rich palate with ripe berries, red fruit, and toasty oak flavors. Cherries and vanilla spice on the mouth lead to a long, lingering finish.;5.0;2015-04-11T20:51:24.000Z;;10.0;46.0
Tried The Past Type & Its My Favorite So This Should Be Great!;I tried Beringer, who makes this, Pink Moscato, had no trouble opening it up with a Corkscrew, one which I just bought from Target in-store, really like its sweet, fruity flavor pink looking wine. I plan to stock up for the Holidays.;5.0;2014-10-03T18:43:40.000Z;;52.0;47.0
A Scrumptious Red!;If you like a fruit forward blend of reds with a very smooth finish and jammy taste, you will love this! I think my 9 year search for my favorite red wine has ended!;5.0;2014-05-17T21:21:39.000Z;;53.0;48.0

Luv This Wine;I love sparkling wine, but I find that most brands are sweet. Im aging and no longer want the sweet stufd. This is medium body wine with strong bubbles (I love bubbles ) .

Always Have Jb Original On Hand;I have been enjoying Jim Beam Original for many years. I started mixing JB-O with Slice while wife and I watched Dallas.

A Bourbon Legend;I typically have this neat or with an ice cube. Its light amber appearance, sweet, woody, mossy nose, and its mild moss, white oak, mellow wintergreen mint, and dried, faintly-candied fruit flavor draws the drinker into an exploration of pin-point distilling execution. Jim Beam Original has a gradual finish, with a ghost of chocolate powder, during the fade out. Highly recommended. RJT;5.0;2017-05-04T00:00:00.000Z;False;85.0;63.0

Solid tequila;My buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game. Frankly when it comes to tequila, I usually brace myself for a rough shot.

Bitter Acrid Terrible Tea;Tastes absolutley nothing like Chinese restaurant tea... not even similar. Its absolutley horrible, bitter and acrid. With shipping I paid 50 cents per bag... what an amazing rip off. You can go to a local Oriental store and get this kind of stuff for 2 cents per bag... and it would probably taste better.;;2013-09-19T00:00:00Z;;134.0;86.0
Very good tea.....;I dont know why some people wrote bad reviews about this tea. It is just like the tea Ive grown up with that I had in Chinese Restaurants. The only complaint I have is that I found the same tea while visiting an Asian store out of town and it was only 2.00 per box while this one was more than double plus a 2.99 shipping fee. I knocked the rating down one star because of the outrageous price this seller charges.;;;;135.0;86.0
Loving It;Had a cup of this tea and it was like reliving the past. Always drank this blend at a small Chinese Resturant in Queens, NY. After my first sip I felt like I was back thier enjoying a big pot of tea. Smooth and Relaxing, great blend and will be ordering more soon.;;2012-05-20T00:00:00Z;;136.0;86.0
Great tea!!;Yes! this IS just like the Chinese restaurant tea. I used to receive a tea bag or two from my favorite Chinese take out, but nobody does that anymore. Id save my teabag for the next day to drink with the leftovers, to enhance the leftovers. Now, I can enjoy this tea anytime. This is a refreshing tea that does not make one feel as if we should be adding milk and/or eating some cookies or cakes with it. This tea can stand alone and refresh the inner soul. I drink it with just a pinch of sugar.;;;;137.0;86.0
Fantastic Tea;I gave this to my husband for christmas and he loves it. Says it smells good, it has a nice flavor and a smooth texture, just like the tea you are served in Chinese Restaurants :);;;;138.0;86.0
Tasty blend of green, jasmine and oolong tea. Hard to find in stores where I live.;I really like this tea and have bought it many times. The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesnt contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people dont like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones dont even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions. (My store had carried it but stopped apparently due to this regional issue -- no longer available in our part of PA.) It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it! Thanks for carrying it, Amazon and friends!;;2015-05-31T00:00:00Z;;139.0;86.0
ILOVETHISTEA;Really, thats all I have to say. I have ordered this tea several times. Tastes EXACTLY like the Chinese tea that you can find in any major Chinese restaurant.;;2013-09-17T00:00:00Z;;140.0;86.0
Good taste, but is it real Ginseng;I really like the taste of the tea, especially cold. Its a green tea mixed with Ginseng, and theyve added licorice root to perhaps sweeten the tea. I dont even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, Im guessing its a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, its very tasty this way! You dont have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round.;;2013-02-13T00:00:00Z;;141.0;86.0
Good taste And Good tea;I like all ingredients in this tea: Green tea, Licorice root and Ginseng. Specially Licorice root can relieve a spasmodic cough and test like Mint;;2013-11-13T06:00:00Z;;142.0;86.0

"""the Best Jerry, The Best""";Pinnacle has been making our Martinis in my family for many years.

Delicious!;This candy is amazing! Im a BIG tea fan. Iced, hot, green, black, whatever kinda tea it is, i like it. The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday. Overall, some of the greatest hard candy ive ever tried, and by far, the best tea candy.;;;;288.0;134.0

Great way to try all three flavors...;This little 3-pack assortment is a great way to try all three flavors of Balis Best Tea Candy. Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real! Before doing that, I will buy a case of 12 packs from a vendor offering free shipping.;;2011-12-27T00:00:00Z;;290.0;134.0

Unusual but good!;Tried the Green Tea Latte while in Aruba and loved them! Tried the three pack and Im hooked. I love the citrus best, but all are different and great throat lozenges (I hate menthol lozenges).;;2010-11-27T00:00:00Z;;295.0;134.0

Fantastic!!!;I have tried the Margarita mix and the Bloody Mary mix. The Margarita mix is fantastic, especially if you add a little lime juice. The Bloody Mary mix is also very good but I like the Zing Zang Bloody Mary a little better and I think it is worth the few extra carbs. I plan to try the rest of the Scales Mixes and have already restocked the Margarita mix.;;2014-01-19T00:00:00Z;;297.0;136.0

GREAT PRODUCT- TERRIBLE PRICE!;3 stars only because this really tasty No Calorie margarita mix cast me 17 FOR ONE BOTTLE!Im a margarita fan and also trying to lose some weight. There arent many really good lime mixers out there in the Low to NO Calorie category, so when I discovered SCALES on the shelf while visiting in Scottsdale AZ (for a reasonable 6.99 bottle), I was delighted to discover how tangy limey good it tastes- just right for excellent margaritas, but cutting about 100-150 calories out of your cocktail!I was dismayed when I returned home (though not exactly surprised) to find that Scales was not available in Washington state. So when I looked for it on Amazon and saw its other flavors offered on prime for 7.99 and the Margarita was offered at 17, I thought this must be for two or three bottles. When only one showed up... well, what the hell.Still a great mixer, but why cant we get it for a reasonable price!!;;2013-07-07T00:00:00Z;;42.0;136.0
0 Carb, 0 Sugar, 0 Satisfaction;To me this tastes like a Crystal Light lemonade or lemon-lime mix. For the price and the many highly positive reviews, I had really expected something much tastier. I added the juice of two limes but still didnt care for the flavor compared to regular (not sugar-free) but less expensive margarita mixes Ive tried. My spouse threw out his drink after one taste. We threw away the bottle so as not to waste any more tequila with this mix.;;2015-09-14T00:00:00Z;;301.0;136.0
Great taste... but pricey online...;For zero carbs/sugar this stuff is great. However the price online here is double that of my local grocery store.

Its the perfect balance of sweet and spicy ginger and reminds me of sipping out of fancy frozen glasses with friends at one my FAVORITE outdoor cocktail bars. Next time Ill just invite them to my backyard! This mix has me excited to try some of the other flavors, but I cant imagine ever passing up on the mule when I see it on the shelf!!

Magnificent oak flavor!;Im a single malt Scotch guy. I generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week. On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor. It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price.

The best;I love a good champagne cocktail and this brand of bitters is MUCH better than the bitters found at the grocery store.;;2009-08-06T05:00:00Z;;562.0;157.0
Bitters are the cure for whatever ails you...;Peychauds is a great way to expand your bitters collection, especially if all you have is the classic Angostura.Its got some nice anise, cherry and other notes in there, and is perfect for a wide variety of cocktails. You cant always use it as a straight up exchange for Angostura, but a lot of times you can. Itll give your cocktail a whole different stir.But why stop at alcoholic drinks Use bitters in all kinds of beverages, both soft and hard.A few dashes of Peychauds in your root beer or cola will transform it into something sublime. The usually muted vanilla and caramel aromatics will really burst forth.And the perfect hangover cure is lots of bitters and soda.Grab a bottle and dont let it get dusty on your shelf!;;2014-08-07T05:00:00Z;;563.0;157.0

Need some for Sazeracs, great in Manhattans;If you want to have a complete battery of bitters for mixing drinks at home or at a bar, you need:Orange BittersPeach BittersLemon BittersOld Fashioned (Angostura-type) BittersPeychauds BittersJaegermeisterCampariUnicumYou cant get Peychauds bitters anywhere else...nothing else compares. I think its one of the most versatile bitters there is. Is great as a digestif, too. I like it more than Underbergs as a digestif.;;;;566.0;157.0
Excellent for making a Sazerac;A must for a Sazerac.-3 oz rye whiskey-3/4 oz simple syrup-Peychaud bitters to taste-absinthe or absinthe substitute-Lemon twist for garnish;;2013-11-17T06:00:00Z;;567.0;157.0
Great product, but it may not be the one you are looking for;If you are looking for bitters for an old fashioned, manhattan, or any other drink that simply says bitters in the recipe, this is probably not what you want. Peychauds bitters taste very different than angostura bitters, as they have a character that tastes more like anise, absinthe, or black licorice. If that is indeed what you are looking for, for a drink such a sazerac, then you are in the right place. This bottle is 10oz, which is the larger size, and will indeed make many sazeracs.;;;;568.0;157.0
Taste of Old New Orleans;Peychauds Bitters is the defining ingredient in the classic New Orleans cocktail known as the Sazerac, allegedly the first cocktail invented in the U.S., dating to the pre-Civil War period.As such, theres no substitute! It lends a mildly bitter taste and a sophisticated aroma to any beverage. In addition to mixing it for Sazeracs (check on line for various recipe versions), I add 7 - 10 drops to an iced glass of tonic or lemon-lime soda when I want a super-low-alcohol beverage with the taste of an alcohol cocktail. I find it soothes both the nerves and the digestive system.;;;;569.0;157.0
Sazerac. Anything else;This is just one of those things you need if you really want a complete bar. They do have a pretty interesting and distinct taste, but it doesnt show up as potently as some other bitters in drinks.I bought the 10oz because it was cheaper per ounce after shipping. Note that Fee and Angostura usually sell their products in 4oz size. I dont think either of those companies make a Peychauds substitute.So what calls for Peychauds bitters besides a Sazerac Well, a tequila/absinthe sazerac for one (thanks to Absinthe Cocktails by Kate Simon). Ill keep looking for other uses...;;;;570.0;157.0
Sazarac Bar at Home;One doesnt need to travel to New Orleans for the perfect Sazarac. Make it with this ingredient, along with some good rye whiskey. This is also good in iced tea....mmmmm!;;;;571.0;157.0
Must have;Adds a nice flavor to manhattans. Lots of flavor. I use Peychauds with other bitters in ice water for a great 0 calorie drink. Vary the amounts of each for a well rounded drink. Peychauds can be used alone because it has the high, medium and base flavor notes. Try it.;;2008-12-04T06:00:00Z;;572.0;157.0
Adds more appeal to drinks;Good stuff, adds interest to many otherwise ordinary cocktails. Im still experimenting with this one, but so far Ive used it in many drink recipes it seems to go especially well with sweet drinks.;;2013-11-02T00:00:00Z;;573.0;157.0

Awesome delivery 4 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No;I havent had a chance to brew this beer, but everything about the process has been great so far. They are in state, so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb. The kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain - but its important. Funny detail, and gives me a sense of their personality. Also, due to this specific brew - you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine. Spice, malts, sweetness. Ughhhh. I keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed.The actual product itself is quite comprehensive - best kit Ive purchased thus far. It comes with stickers for your bottle caps, (great idea guys!), was comparatively priced against competitors beers, a large bag of liquid malt, a smaller bag of dry malt, a can of pumpkin pie mix (debating tossing in another can on my own), brown sugar, a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon, bittering hops, cheesecloth, priming sugar and dry yeast. Wow. Excellent care in their product for an absolutely appropriate price.I Cannot WAIT to brew this beer, and I absolutely anticipate doing a lot more business with Jaspers.;5.0;;;642.0;166.0
Frighteningly Good One person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you Yes No;My 3rd homebrew ever and a step up from my other kit beers. It smelled so amazing brewing and fermenting. Despite my rookie mistake by moving it to secondary fermentation after active fermentation was over it was a forgiving beer.

REALLY GOOD;This tastes amazing, so far the best from Jaspers.The magic potion is just annoying to brew with. When you add it to the beer it turns into a mucusy substance and you need to strain it out which is really hard. Other than that it is great!;;2015-03-04T00:00:00Z;;641.0;166.0
Good beer though;This is an extract kit. I dont recall seeing that anywhere in the description. Good beer though.;;;;645.0;166.0
Awesome delivery;I havent had a chance to brew this beer, but everything about the process has been great so far. They are in state, so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb. The kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain - but its important. Funny detail, and gives me a sense of their personality. Also, due to this specific brew - you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine. Spice, malts, sweetness. Ughhhh. I keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed.The actual product itself is quite comprehensive - best kit Ive purchased thus far. It comes with stickers for your bottle caps, (great idea guys!), was comparatively priced against competitors beers, a large bag of liquid malt, a smaller bag of dry malt, a can of pumpkin pie mix (debating tossing in another can on my own), brown sugar, a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon, bittering hops, cheesecloth, priming sugar and dry yeast. Wow. Excellent care in their product for an absolutely appropriate price.I Cannot WAIT to brew this beer, and I absolutely anticipate doing a lot more business with Jaspers.;;;;642.0;166.0
Nice kit, but...;I bought two of these kits to make ten gallons. After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primarys I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. Its got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. Im not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good. The abv came out at about 6.9 after adding an extra pound of dextrose.I expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking.;3.0;2014-03-03T00:00:00Z;;647.0;166.0

On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend.

It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price.

Great taste and texture;These traditional winegums are soft, gummy drops that are similar to but chewier than jujubes.

Im stuck with 6.6kg. of these things and Im seriously tempted to throw them in the garbage.Smarten up, Gustavs!

Just returned from Bermuda with some Stormy Ginger Beer. ...;Just returned from Bermuda with some Stormy Ginger Beer. Have to watch sugar intake so back at home I bought diet Stormy and did a side by side comparison. Confirmed the reviews that indicated that diet Stormy has noticeably less ginger flavor. I found a local source for Barritts diet ginger beer (made in Bermuda and preceded Goslings ginger beer) and did a side by side comparison against diet Stormy. The diet Barritts had noticeably more ginger flavor.;;2014-09-06T05:00:00Z;;762.0;180.0

Goslings inferior diet ginger beer;I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice. Although I highly doubt it, Goslings diet ginger beer may be the superior product for use in Dark n Stormy or Moscow Mule cocktails.;;2014-08-15T05:00:00Z;;764.0;180.0
Great if you prefer dry vs. sweet;I love ginger beer. This one is among the drier varieties, so it is light, crisp and refreshing. I would recommend this one for mixing lower calorie drinks. Great ginger flavor. I would buy this again.;;2014-09-14T05:00:00Z;;765.0;180.0
Disappointed;I bought this from a local store to make Moscow Mules, and I know Goslings is more about the Dark and Stormy, but I have to say I was very disappointed in this product. It didnt have as strong of ginger bite as I was looking for, but I guess thats what I get for going diet. I will stick to Royals from now on.;;2014-07-15T05:00:00Z;;766.0;180.0

Never judge a book by its cover, because this Irish Red is amazing;I reached out in the comments to ask another member how this turned out, but to no avail. Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. Its not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). Id purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Reds.;;2015-10-29T00:00:00Z;;792.0;188.0

Id by them again if they change the flavoring, but id say just stick to the plain and get your own sauce.;;;False;804.0;193.0

Heavenly root beer! Clean ingredients, non gmo!;This really is the best root beer I have ever tasted! I usually buy it in our grocery store (about 4.50 per four pack), but its sold out a lot! The ingredients are clean and natural, while most of the other root beers have junk ingredients, caramel color. I quit drinking traditional sodas years ago, because of the nasty ingredients and taste. Virgils is absolute heaven in a root beer float. Virgils root beer is micro brewed, smooth and creamy and I am addicted to it, I think. Its worth every penny.Description and ingredients:Virgils is a superb blend of spices and herbs gathered from the world over anise, licorice, vanilla (bourbon), cinnamon, clove, wintergreen, sweet birch, molasses, nutmeg, pimento berry oil, balsam oil and cassia oil.Ingredients: Purified carbonated water, unbleached cane sugar, caramelized unrefined cane sugar, citric acid, herbs and spices!

Very Good, But Needs A Few Changes.;Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgils Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgils is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us. Virgils RootBeer is natural and definitely different, but as a root beer, I can only give it three and a half Amazon stars, rounded off to four stars, as Amazon requires ratings to be in whole numbers.The Nutrition Facts, and Ingredients, as listed on the bottle:Nutrition Facts:Serving size: 12 oz.

Yum.;Delicious. I recently went through a dirty martini phase and was frustrated with the inconsistent quality of my drinks. Some were fabulous while others tasted outright disgusting. A waste of precious quality vodka. I quickly figured out that for me, only salt brines will do. No vinegar.I was discarding a lot of expensive olives for the sake of a few drinks and thought surely there must be a source for brine only. I read reviews and ingredient lists until finding Dirty Sue. This product aint cheap (its salt water after all) but I was not disappointed. Like I said before, NO VINEGAR. Im very pleased. Will be purchasing several bottles for Christmas and pairing them with a nice Vodka as gifts.;;2014-11-06T00:00:00Z;;896.0;205.0

Best Ive tried!;I have been a dirty martini drinker for years and Ive never been able to find a good olive juice. Other brands claim to be 100 olive juice and they are really just glorified salt water. Dirty Sue is pure olive juice in a bottle. Or should I say pure magic in a bottle. I have a bottle of Dirty Sue in my fridge and a bottle of Ketel One in my freezer and I am a happy man.;;2007-04-17T00:00:00Z;;898.0;205.0

Why couldnt I have thought of this!;This product is great! I am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in Hollywood, CA and I was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives. Its a huge waste of time, and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately. Once I discovered Dirty Sue, not only did it fix these problems, but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice. Lets face it, if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini, why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it;;;;900.0;205.0

Not sweet, not martinis--salty Tequila/Margaritas;I like the Modern Cocktail packs, but was a little misled by the description for this one on Amazon.Possibly not the manufacturers fault - their package description is spot on.On Amazon it says something like add gin or vodka for Martinis and other similar drinks.But this one is all formulated for Tequila - all the drinks are Margaritas or other tequila drinks.Instead of the sugar that comes with the other drinks, this one comes with salt.I am not saying its bad - for 0 calories, obviously they couldnt use sugar. but i just assumed they would be just like the other mixes but made with nutrisweet or something.As long as you know what to expect - a much less sweet drink that goes better with tequila salt - then they are fine. of course, you can put whatever liquor you want in there, but i tried one with vodka and it just tasted odd to me.Here is exactly what the drinks are: Mango Skinny Margarita, Blood Orange Tequila Sunrise, Classic Skinny Margarita, Strawberry Tequila Lemonade, Acai Blueberry Skinny Margarita.;3.0;2013-03-31T00:00:00.000Z;;934.0;206.0

Best Easily-Available Premium Tonic Water;My wife and I just performed a taste test of three different tonic waters. We used Bombay Gin in all three to keep the variables to one--the tonic water. We used Schweppes Tonic Water, Q Tonic Water, and Fever-Tree Tonic Water. We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagrams. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins. We tried Fever-Tree with Hendricks Gin and it was good, better than Hendricks in martinis, with which we prefer Bombay Sapphire.;;;;949.0;209.0
I love Fever-Tree!;After doing an Internet search for tonic waters that do not contain high-fructose corn syrup, I only found few options. The reviews for Fever-Tree were so positive that I decided to give it a try. They reviews are right: this tonic water is amazing! I happen to prefer vodka tonics to gin and tonics, but the taste of Fever-Tree is so pure that it works with both equally well. My husband prefers G and Ts, and he said it has changed the way he views tonic water. What started out as a search for a healthier alternative has actually ended up changing the way we see mixers. I love this tonic water and will be ordering more. With the free shipping, its actually not much more expensive than Schweppes, especially when you consider that Schweppes goes flat so quickly in the huge liter bottle. Schweppes is also FULL of sodium, and Fever-Tree is not. Check this tonic water out: youll be glad you did!!;;2010-09-23T05:00:00Z;;950.0;209.0
You dont smell it son, you drink it.;Man oh man, I love Fever Trees Ginger Beer. I asked for a ginger ale at the St. Regis in San Francisco and got this instead. What a pleasant surprise! The smell of ginger transformed me to another world. A world of sakura petals falling softly on verdant, rolling hills with a warm breeze and snow capped mountains in the background. I took a sip and little pebbles of joy started dancing in my mouth. And the fun didnt just go away like with your average drink. The taste lingers, prolonging the experience. This is a drink for parties, after-parties and after-after-parties. Or to be enjoyed alone.Theres a scripture that describes my reaction to this drink. And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit. (1 Nephi 8:12)If you like it, youll know you are in select company. I gave two bottles to my next door neighbor. They returned one unopened. A friend said it cleared her sinuses, but did little else for her. My wife rolled her eyes the same way she does when I burn incense. Fine. All the more for me.After returning from San Francisco, I started my search. For six months I searched. Whole Foods doesnt have it. Trader Joes doesnt have it. Your local grocery store will almost certainly not have it. But Amazon has it. And now so can you! Let the sakura petals fall and the joy pebble dance commence!;;2010-05-04T05:00:00Z;;951.0;209.0
This is such a painful review to write..........;These were once the best Ginger Beers in the world. Nothing else even came close. I had been buying these by the case for years from Amazon (sometimes as many as 1-3 cases per month)! They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well. He said that it was obvious that the factory thought it was still making Tonic Water and let Quinine or whatever makes up tonic, run into these instead of natural spring water, as always used. That would explain the strange and unrecognizable bitterness. All I knew is that I was now stuck with three cases of stuff that tasted awful.I contacted Fever Tree directly to make them aware of this problem, as well as Brands Of Britain, who is the sole, authorized, distributor here in the United States.Read more;;2013-10-29T05:00:00Z;;952.0;209.0

Its that easy!!!;Hi, this is Cocktail Artist Robert Porter. First, Id like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What Ive done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes its that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesnt have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create. Make the glass your canvas, mix it like you mean it. Robert.;5.0;2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z;False;978.0;214.0

This mix... this powerful concoction of pure ecstasy ... is unbelievably awesome and will likely turn me into a raging alcoholic passed out in a gutter occasionally coming to the surface to scream I need more as monkeys and degenerate courtesans frolic in my bodily fluids streaming from both ends. Its that freaking good folks... buy it... buy cases of it... snort it, drink it, shoot it, whatever you do ... just try it! Once you do youll be on here leaving another depraved review... hopefully three times more twisted than mine! God Speed. God Speed.;5.0;2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z;False;311.0;214.0
A New Spin On An Old Classic;After finding out that I was hosting an impromptu b-day party for a friend I scrambled knowing that my beverage knowledge was very basic, limited to essentially beer, wine and liquor/soda. Further, I knew that I would soon host several liquor pros, including those that would size-up my novice bartending abilities. Enter the Cocktail Artist Essential Bar Ingredients Premium Manhattan Mix. Making my pre-shindig trip to Walmart, I circled the aisles looking for something that could help me out. I came across a bottle of this liquid magic which allowed me to craft top-notch Manhattans. To this day, I still am asked by party patrons what was my secret recipe, go figure!

Do yourself a favor and purchase;Not personally into pre made mixes, but bought this for entertaining friends the other night. Was extremely impressed! So smooth and balanced! Everyone LOVED their manhattans! All you have to do is add your whiskey or bourbon of choice. There are no artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrups in the mix either. Just pure cane sugar. Honestly probably safer than using the liqueurs on the market! As a bartender myself Im telling you to get this product!!;5.0;2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z;False;990.0;214.0

Magnificent oak flavor!;Im a single malt Scotch guy. I generally have two fingers neat with a quality cigar about once a week. On a stressful day, Ill have a couple of beers or so after work before the family gets home. The trouble is the beer gut that comes with that trend. I was looking for something similar to my favorite Scotch, which is a little out of my budget to drink daily. Jim Beam Black is an awesome substitute with the rich white oak aroma and flavor. It isnt near as smooth as my favorite Scotch, but the flavor is on point. Thank you Jim Beam for putting this great whiskey out there at an affordable price.

Not worth it.;If youre going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house, this is not worth the time or effort. The nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose.;2.0;2017-03-26T00:00:00.000Z;False;1037.0;220.0
Works great for household usage!;I also got this during Sams Spring sale. Having messed with my fathers 10 year old Electric pressure washer, I didnt have high hopes. I was looking for something inexpensive that would clean my driveway, grill and fence every so often. Yes, gas models are more powerful, but theyre more expensive and you need to maintain them. First off - the build quality. Seems rugged. Metal couplings for hoses (vs plastic for my dads old one). How well it does: Concrete was cleaned! The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean. Also had no issues cleaning my grill from 2 years of grease. Overall with a 2 year warranty Im pretty happy with this!;5.0;2017-05-17T00:00:00.000Z;False;1038.0;220.0

Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita;Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers Theyre enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.;5.0;2015-01-30T00:00:00.000Z;;1124.0;226.0

Amazing;This was out of stock almost everywhere and I nabbed the last one on Amazon. It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regans, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regans, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.;;2013-05-18T05:00:00Z;;1138.0;228.0
Fantastic Bitters;I use these in all kinds of tiki drinks and they are really great - they have lots of warm spice notes and lend an exotic flavor to rum based drinks. I would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off, but Im a huge fan personally. Its tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond Angostura, so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails.;;2013-06-29T05:00:00Z;;1139.0;228.0

Warm dark notes;The Burlesque has a distinctive central flavor - I think its walnut husk, aromatic and bitter in itself, and easy to pair with warm flavors. I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters Ive tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, its good. If I didnt make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: Im not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper. Perhaps you get more repeatability and precision with a dropper, until the bottle runs low, but I prefer the convenience of a shaker, which you can find easily at Amazon.;4.0;2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z;;1196.0;228.0

When I got it, I took out the dropper and dripped a little right on my tongue and instantly fell in love. It has the depth and complexity of flavor you expect from bitters, but its not overwhelming. I love a glass of rum with just a couple dashes of this in it, or in an East India Trading Co. cocktail (with rum, sherry and amaro liqueur). I highly recommend.;5.0;2015-06-10T00:00:00.000Z;;1199.0;228.0

Xocolatl Mole + tequila happiness;This is specifically for the Xocolatl Mole bitters as Amazon seems to have lumped all the reviews together. Tasted in person at a bitters bar at Oxbow Market in Napa and was excited to find easily on Amazon. A few drops in any tequila drink makes me happy - just a subtle hint of chocolate and heat. As I often use bitter/sour mixers less is more, or else it pushes the drink way too bitter. Will definitely buy again if I ever finish the bottle I have - a little goes a long way!;5.0;2015-05-20T00:00:00.000Z;;1202.0;228.0

Beware the foul plastic dropper rod;Dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off. Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to ones drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermens Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, its disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material. Bittermens, you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod.;2.0;2015-01-11T00:00:00.000Z;;1209.0;228.0
Warning: SHRUB VINEGAR;Just a friendly reminder: Shrub bitters are bitters that contain lots of vinegar. If the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you, then you may enjoy this. If it doesnt, then you do NOT want these. (Take a whiff and it smells like someone dying easter eggs.) (If you want a spicy bitter thats not a shrub, try Scrappys Habanero firewater bitters instead!);2.0;2015-01-05T00:00:00.000Z;;1210.0;228.0

Fast Shipping, great product. Limited uses.;Ive had this for about 2 weeks now and I cant seem to find too many uses for it.

Shipping and packaging is excellent.;4.0;2014-06-12T00:00:00.000Z;;1216.0;228.0
Interesting - wish it had a little more heat.;I bought this for one specific purpose - as an ingredient for a cocktail called Carter Beats the Devil . . . and, it works great. Its not quite as prominent of an ingredient as the chili tincture that the restaurant in San Francisco used, but it does the job - just wish it had more punch per drop.Ive used it quite a bit - and, since it is measured in drops, itll probably last me forever.I am interested now in trying more of Bittermens bitters . . . glad I bought this one.;4.0;2014-06-09T00:00:00.000Z;;1217.0;228.0

Amazing;The Tear Dropper is a bit confusing your first time, but these are simply delicious. The aroma hits you right off the bat when you open the bottle.

Best chocolate bitters Ive found;I love chocolate bitters in a Manhattan. The full flavor of these bitters balances nicely with the richness of Carpano Antica--not everything does and you need a Rye with some kick to bring it all together.;5.0;2014-06-23T00:00:00.000Z;;1235.0;228.0
Excellent cocktail flavoring;This stuff has just the right amount of heat - enough to be worth using, but not so much that you can make your cocktails undrinkable without effort.

The Perfect Bitters;Not wanting alcohol on an outing with colleagues but wanting something that has taste, I ordered club soda with bitters. It was a well sorted bar, and the bar tender gave me the choice.

Not as hot as I wanted.;This doesnt put out the heat I wanted. To get a good bite you add so much it effects the flavor of the drink.Its not terrible. But a chopped jalapeo can get just as much if not more heat , with a better flavor.;3.0;2013-12-18T00:00:00.000Z;;1240.0;228.0
Bright (not bitter) celery flavor for drinks!;While Bittermens primarily makes various kinds of bitters for making drinks -- this one is not technically bitters, but a tart shrub -- especially good for adding to Bloody Marys, and an amazing Bloody Shrimp Martini. Im sure you could make a good drink in the traditional shrub recipes -- but a dropper of this really brightens up even the most plain-jane Bloody recipe with a shot of liquid celery flavor. Love it!;5.0;2013-12-03T00:00:00.000Z;;1241.0;228.0

One of my favorite bitters!;Mixology has become a passion of mine--Im known in my friend circle for making GFCs (Good Fn Cocktails!). Bittermens Hellfire is one of my secret ingredients. It adds just the right subtle heat to anything I make.Ive carefully selected over a dozen really top-notch hand-crafted bitters to add just the right extra something to my cocktails. These folks have created one of the very best bitters out there. (Thank you!);5.0;2013-07-15T00:00:00.000Z;;1244.0;228.0

Amazing stuff;So the Habanero Bitters are great in a version of a Margarita we do that traditionally used tabasco. I like this at least as much and you dont get any of the vinegar flavor one does from Tabasco.Also, LOVE the tiki bitters and a bitter monk is my new favorite cocktail just because I get to use this in it.Great stuff.;5.0;2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z;;1246.0;228.0
Just wish it hadnt spilled in shipping;These bitters are great and the dropper bottle is an easy way to use th estuff in all kinds of cocktails. My only complaint was that the Boston Bitahs leaked in transit, so the entire box smelled (great) and I only have about 25 of the bottle remaining. Still, that was one bottle out of an order of 12 so Im not complaining.;4.0;2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z;;1246.0;228.0
Fantastic Bitters;I use these in all kinds of tiki drinks and they are really great - they have lots of warm spice notes and lend an exotic flavor to rum based drinks. I would say there is a strong nutmeg note here which can put some folks off, but Im a huge fan personally. Its tough to find bitters that work in tiki drinks beyond Angostura, so this is a great addition to the bar for people that make a lot of tropical themed cocktails.;5.0;2013-06-29T00:00:00.000Z;;1248.0;228.0
Goes a long way!;I was at the Kentucky bourbon mixology competition recently and all the bartenders were making spicy flavored drinks. I looked all around for this stuff and finely ordered it here.My first cocktail was great:2 oz. Rye Whiskey (or bourbon)0.5 oz. Simple Syrup1 Lemon Twist2 Dashes of Peychauds Bitters30 Drops of Bittermens Habanero Bitters (Start with 20 and increase from there, it gets hot!)Serve it on ice;5.0;2013-06-01T00:00:00.000Z;;1249.0;228.0
Amazing;This was out of stock almost everywhere and I nabbed the last one on Amazon. It was part of a gift for my boyfriend for his new bar set, the something extra after the staples of Regans, Angostura, and Peychauds, and the smallest and most expensive bottle of the group. It has been worth every penny -- complex, flavorful, rich, not overly sweet, a real winner. The Bittermens website has some wonderful recipes, but we have been most enjoying it so far with a large rock, 2 shots, a dash of Regans, 7 drops or so of this one and a splash each of lemon and soda water.;5.0;2013-05-18T00:00:00.000Z;;1250.0;228.0

Delicious in a Mojito;I mentioned to the bar tender that the secret ingredient in a Mojito was a couple of drops of bitters. He did not have the Angostura bitters so we tried the Bittermens Hopped Grapefruit Bitters. All I can say is Ay, caramba!The bitters gave the Mojito a very refreshing taste!;5.0;2013-03-03T00:00:00.000Z;;1253.0;228.0
Exquisite taste sensation!;This flavor of bitters is quite unique! There is a subtle warmth and profound chocolate flavor that is haunting. We like it in a tequila-based coffee liqueur. Add half a shot of good scotch and you have a drink worthy of the finest company you know...;5.0;2012-09-15T00:00:00.000Z;;885.0;228.0
Bitters complimentary to Tropical drinks;For any Tikiphile out there, these are a great addition to any tropical drink recipes. I substitute them in place of Angostura bitters in Zombies, Rum Barrels and 151 Swizzles. They may be a bit niche in their application, but its a wonderful product nonetheless.;5.0;2012-02-04T00:00:00.000Z;;1255.0;228.0

Great stuff!;I am a whiskey sour lover, but imbibing only when out to dinner. Hubby suggested trying home. I was so happy to find this product my Walmart Supercenter! First, its taste is great. Not much difference in taste from Mr. and Mrs. Ts, which is slightly higher in price. Prior to purchasing Walmart, wasnt aware they carried mixers - foolish on my part - duh, they have everything! I was paying like 4.50 to 5.00 per bottle other stores. At Walmart, believe it or not, it is...........2.88!!!!!!! So I stocked up bought 3 bottles. They also have it in a lite version......sugar-free and I thought that would be great......not so. I drink suger-free pop, but this doesnt taste as good in the sugar-free version. So tomorrow I am going to exchange 2 of the bottles for the regular type. Hey, a few carbs here and there.....oh well! Love Walmart! I especially love that you have the ability to check the availability of the product online before treking out, especially since the mixer is pretty much only sold the Supercenters, and we have 4 within a 20 mile radius......but only one has it!;5.0;2012-04-18T00:00:00.000Z;False;1299.0;234.0

Pure agave splendor without needless wood byproducts;Lets face it, distilled alcohol products arent health foods. But clear liquor products (vodka, gin, white rum, and silver tequila) contain less toxic wood solute byproducts (tannins and formaldehydes) than heavily-aged dark liquors. Science aside, Sauza Signature Silver is a splendid treat and delightful to sip. The clean, crisp agave taste that makes tequila so special is front-and-center without the woody heaviness of darker tequilas. Tequila is an acquired taste, and Sauza Signature Blue is a taste worth acquiring...a taste to be savored.;5.0;2017-06-28T00:00:00.000Z;False;1327.0;236.0

Dont waste your calories;Actually, the Great Value crescent rolls in my areas Walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing ... plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls. Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now Im extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.;1.0;2013-06-29T00:00:00.000Z;False;1434.0;256.0
Horrible!;If I could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating, I would! I would even give it a negative star. Of course, whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can, you expect a POP! Well, nothing happenedat first. I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase. From now on, I know to go with a more reputable brand.;1.0;2014-05-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;1435.0;256.0
These have to be opened and rolled cold.;I bought three of these for the first time to make a new breakfast casserole. One package was opened right after taking them out of the fridge and was the bottom of the casserole. The second package was opened after everything was prepped and put into the casserole. It was useless and had to be thrown away. It was a ball of sticky, gooey, unshapable dough. Into the trash it went and my husband ran out to get another brand. We had one pack left that I just used this morning straight out of the fridge and the rolls were just as good as the name brand. My little ones even had seconds. I think that the fact that they were still really cold when I opened the package and put them on the cookie sheet really helped.;4.0;2013-10-06T00:00:00.000Z;False;1436.0;256.0
Great Value Great Product - Works as expected.;This is a good product and it works as expected. I am not sure why so many reviews are there criticizing it. You are buying a dough and you got to mold it as you need.. not sure being flaky and all is a valid critic for this product... it holds shape as it should and bakes nicely...It tastes good and nice... This worked just as planned and I was able to make rolls as planned..!!!! Will recommend !!! Thank you walmart !!!;5.0;2014-08-11T00:00:00.000Z;False;1437.0;256.0
Very difficult to use;First off, I could not get the package open. Then, when I opened it, there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents. I had to break off bits of dough, roll them in my hands, and make drop biscuits. Terrible!;2.0;2010-12-04T00:00:00.000Z;False;1438.0;256.0
Impossible to make crescent rolls with;These were terrible!!! It seems like they are just crammed into the packaging. There is no way to roll them out into triangles. It just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them. I ended up having to roll it all out and make my own! Too much work! Next time I will be spending the extra 0.30 or so and going with Pillsbury!! Heck, Id even pay 5.00 more to not deal with this garbage!;1.0;2016-06-20T00:00:00.000Z;False;1439.0;256.0
Absolutely useless;First, lets establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents. Hence crescent rolls. These are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls. The dough stuck together would not unroll. Where I needed triangles, I came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough. It was 100 useless for the recipe I was making. I was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these.;1.0;2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;1440.0;256.0
Great Value Crescent Rolls;The dough looked like it was crammed into the packaging. I could not use it without combining the dough to roll out and cut wedges myself. Then they came out hard and very small. It mustve been at the end of the line and what was left over. This has happened more than once, will not purchase again. The savings is not worth it.;1.0;2016-03-17T00:00:00.000Z;False;1441.0;256.0
good eating;Crescent rolls are something of an extra for us. We dont buy them real often because of the price but, Great Value crescents are so good and the price is reasonable that we dont have of splurge. I make rolls, use them for crusts, roll apple slices in them and slice them in long strips and sugar and cinnamon them. Just twist them and you hace a great and fast snack. Good eating.;5.0;2015-10-23T00:00:00.000Z;False;1442.0;256.0
Poor choice for not much savings;These rolls were much smaller than Pillsburys and much harder to get out of the can. They ripped and shredded making them just about worthless. I will not purchase again.;1.0;2016-02-08T00:00:00.000Z;False;1443.0;256.0

I started the kit 2 days ago and added one cup of medium toast american oak, half a can of frozen concentrate grape juice, and some blanched raisins with dates. I added water to 5.25 gallons and got a specific gravity of 1.095. It smells great, and fermentation is in high gear. I expect I will rack twice (week 2 6) and bulk age for several months before bottling. I am quite satisfied so far.

Very good low cost wine kit!;I have made over 60 wine kits over the last 4 years. This kit performed as well as any of the other kits. I bought the Merlot Fontana Wine kit and added about a cup of oak chips and about 3/4 cup dried elderberries which I do with all my Merlots. At 4 weeks I stabilized and put in the clarifiers. As always, I tasted the wine to establish dryness and flavor at the 4 week mark. From my experience, I believe this will be one of my better Merlots. The oak added the dryness I was looking for, the elderberries gave it a nice fruity flavor and the base Merlot had a nice all around wine flavor. I expect to bottle and age this for no less than 6 months, at which time I believe it will be a very good tasting wine. Thanks to Fontana and Amazon for supplying us with a low cost, good tasting wine kit. Hoping they add more varietals at this price in the near future.;;2015-05-06T00:00:00Z;;1461.0;258.0

Delicious Summer Mai tai Coctail Mix;I was so happy to have located Mr Mrs T Mai Tai Mix at Wallmart on-line. It is nearly impossible to find it in NJ (grocery or liquor stores). Usually, I am not a fan of any bar drink mixes, particularly now sugary ones, but this one is a fabulous concoction! Not too sweet, the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour, with a touch of bitter almonds. Just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing Baccardi Rum garnish with Maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple (on a skewer). I have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer :) Had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors. We are hooked! Wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable SH charge. It arrived in good condition (product is shelf stable). Ill be ordering it again next season, or maybe earlier if we want to have a nice summer cocktail in the winter months!;5.0;2012-08-30T00:00:00.000Z;False;1463.0;259.0
Good for a premixed drink;I like to add a shot of light rum and a shot of spiced rum. Its a little sweeter than I would prefer but not bad at all for a premixed drink. It has been a hit at our pool parties.;4.0;2014-08-06T00:00:00.000Z;True;1464.0;259.0
Best Mai Tai mix;Ive tried a number of different Mai Tai mixes and this is the best one by far. But it can be hard to find in stores. Im glad I found it online so that I no longer have to worry about finding someplace that carries it.

I like this one better.;I could no longer fine my usual brand, even on the company website so I started looking for a new Mai Tai mixer. Look it up, these are complicated to make from scratch. I kept seeing this brand so I decided to order it and was very pleasantly surprized.

Fairly good value, okay selection.;I grew up loving Shasta, but I can never find their best flavors. It comes with lemon-lime, orange, grape, and fruit punch. My favorite is the punch and, in my opinion, the lemon-lime is better than most lemon-lime sodas. The grape and orange are just okay. It is nothing special, but it is a pretty good value. Also nice to have a variety of sodas handy on hot summer days, especially when having guests over.;4.0;2015-07-16T00:00:00.000Z;False;1471.0;262.0

Great Product, excellent taste!;I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.;5.0;2014-06-01T00:00:00.000Z;False;1501.0;266.0

Greattt BUT;It looks great. A real attention piece in our kitchen. Tons of space. I removed the lower rack and have some sodas, other various drinks from time to time.... my only and bigest issue with this is that I can never get the temperature down past 51. If thats okay for you, this is a great cooler. My wife likes her wine cold and in an ideal situation temp would be 41-44 degrees. This is not capable of that no matter how long you leave it on. One more thing, everytime you open the door even if its for a matter of seconds you will see a temperature rise of about 3 degrees. Foolishness. Great for the price but thats it.;;2015-07-04T00:00:00Z;;1509.0;270.0
Worth the low price.;Didnt have any reviews when I bought it so I just paid the extra cash for the Assurion insurance. I really like this thing. Sleep and stylish looks really good in my living room for my expensive beer collection that I wanted to cellar. I dont think you can cellar anything where I live in SoCal so this helped out a lot. On the lower levels of the temp range the fan is pretty loud. If you can handle that then you will be OK.;;2015-03-26T00:00:00Z;;1510.0;270.0

So far so good;We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, wont have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so dont put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we wont have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.;;2015-09-23T00:00:00Z;;1512.0;270.0

very happy so far;We received this two days ago in perfect condition. so far I am very satisfied. The unit looks great, operates fairly quietly, and is maintaining a perfect 55 degrees for our good reds. i only have 55 bottles in it so I have not tested the full capacity. the only con so far is that we have a few fatter than normal bottles that did not fit on certain shelves and some taller bottles that did not fit on the bottom shelves because of the compressor behind. But these are minor annoyances.;;;;1516.0;270.0

This makes a great syrup for pancakes and waffles!;I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I dont drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldnt work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldnt even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. Its not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I cant find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy.

Better than the bottle;I developed an appreciation for this drink during my days of frequent airline travel. I prefer to drink them straight (without booze). As a result, I started buying bottles of the mix at the grocery store--because finding this by the can in the real world is impossible. IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, when you buy this by the bottle something happens. The first glass tastes exactly as you expected. But once you open the bottle, if you dont drink the contents within 24-36 hours the taste turns. Keeping a stock of cans in the house, therefore, is essential. I live in a major metropolitan area and I cant find these cans in any store. Not grocery stores (including mom pop, big chains, high-end small chains, etc), not liquor stores (including corner stores or BevMo). Enter Amazon. Im very grateful I can buy this by the can here on the interwebs. I personally prefer the smaller-size cans to the 11.5 ounce.

Very Good Bloody Mary Mix - Highly Recommended!;Mr Mrs Ts Bloody Mary Mix is our favorite off-the-shelf Bloody Mary mix and these 5.5oz cans are very convenient. We use the less expensive larger bottles if we know our guests will be having Bloody Marys but like these cans for single servings since the larger bottles need to be refrigerated after being opened.We add a little more than 1oz of Vodka (your taste may vary) and find that it really doesnt need anything else for most people. It is just spicy enough for my wife, but I put an extra shot of Tabasco Sauce in mine and my mother cuts hers with a little tomato juice to dilute the heat a little. These are also good straight (without any spirits added) and as substitute for tomato juice in cooking (particularly vegetable stock) to add an extra zing to your dishes.The 24 can case is a good value (especially if you have Prime or qualify for free Super Saver shipping) since we could only find them in smaller packs locally and at a much higher price per can.Highly Recommended!CFH;;;;1574.0;278.0
Aromatic;To compare with other orange bitters: these are more aromatic-tasting and have more of a real orange zest flavor than Fees orange, which are more of a candy orange flavor, though they differ from Angostura orange, which taste more like Angostura aromatic bitters mixed with Fees orange bitters. This is not to say that it is better different cocktails work better with the other two. I find that a dash of these ones turns an otherwise decent sidecar into an incredible one.;;;;1575.0;279.0
better bitters;Regans Orange Bitters No.6 is not only a wonderful flavor for mixed drinks but makes water, yep plain ol water, taste fabulous!Purchased 3 bottles knowing that at least 2 of them will make wonderful stocking stuffers.;;;;1576.0;279.0
Best Orange Bitter;Ive tried 5 other orange bitters, and I like this one the best. Not too sweet or citrus intensive (like Angostura). A little bit of a spice like flavor to compliment the orange. Works perfect in my Cherry Manhattan -- 3 parts Wild Turkey Rye, 1 part Herring Cherry liqueur, 2 dashes of Regans, 2 Merry Maraschino cherries and a spoon of cherry juice from the cherry jar. So goooooood!;;2013-10-16T05:00:00Z;;1577.0;279.0
My favorite orange bitters;In my opinion, this is the best all around orange bitters on the market. It has a very bitter, but complex flavor profile. For a lighter, more citrusy orange bitters, try Fee brothers west indian. But Regans adds more depth to most (though not all) cocktails.;;2013-07-25T05:00:00Z;;1578.0;279.0
Going through a bitters period.;Regans Orange Bitters 6 is just as advertised. Intense and very potent, it will give your Manhattan or Old Fashioned a real kick in the pants. I want to experiment using it with Crepes Suzette or Grand Marnier cakes - it should intensify and enhance quite well. In addition: If you have not tried Fee Brothers Old Fashion Aromatic Bitters or Peychauds Aromatic Cocktail Bitters - then you have not experienced what bitters can do for your cocktails - or vanilla ice cream - for that matter! I am afraid that the old stand-by Angostura just doesnt compare - and I like Angostura very much!;;2008-10-09T05:00:00Z;;1579.0;279.0
The best bitters Ive found;These orange bitters are very flavorful and, unlike several other brands, are not overly sweet. They are excellent in any of the dryer liquors. I always seek this product out over others of this type.;;2013-07-17T05:00:00Z;;1580.0;279.0

Your Secret Ingredient;Bitters are making a resurgence these days and I know many bars (at least here in NYC) are bringing back a properly made cocktail. Looking at old cocktail books from the 20s, 30s, and 40s I found that bitters were a key ingredient in many classic cocktails. After doing extensive research I learned that Regans made some of the best, if not the best, orange bitters (go to their website and read the story behind this product). Your other choices are Fee Brothers and Angostura. Regans however gets, and in my opinion, deserves top billing when it comes to orange bitters. These bitters are great in a variety of drinks and I usually put two dashes in my Old Raj martinis. Although you dont get a strong orange flavor per se you do notice that these bitters subtly enhance the complexity of the drink. Try these and you wont be disappointed. Go to Regans website to find literally hundreds of drink recipes that use their bitters. Youll be inspired to make something more than a boring vodka tonic or gin martini.;;2009-03-27T05:00:00Z;;1582.0;279.0
Not ready for prime time;I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrichs book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regans orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regans. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.;;2010-11-02T05:00:00Z;;1583.0;280.0
An orange bitters worthy of the Angostura name;I think its fair to say that Angosturas ubiquitous aromatic bitters are the standard against which all other aromatic bitters are judged. And with the release of Angosturas orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch. I am a huge fan of Regans orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angosturas offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange. Brilliant. I highly recommend these bitters for anyone who needs a bit more orange accent in your cocktails -- and really, who doesnt;;;;1584.0;280.0
A Dash of Brilliance from Angostura;Angostura has been a brand name well-known to my family for generations. As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor! I havent yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer. Like the original, the more you add, the more pronounced the flavor can be so the flavor can range from a delicate hint to bold.;;;;1585.0;280.0
Nice product but price a head scratcher;Angostura Orange Bitters is now the third product in a tiny little product niche that includes long-standing stalwart Fee Brothers and Regans No. 6. Since the traditional Angostura Bitters (essential ingredient in Manhattan and Pegu Club cocktails) is an institution that has extremely wide distribution, this product is piggybacking off the older products brand recognition and iconic status. So why does this product cost 9.95 for 4 oz. when Regans No. 6 costs 6.26 for 5 oz. and Fee Brothers costs 6.99 for 5 oz. The answer is that price probably doesnt matter if youve got the distribution. How many bottles of orange bitters you gonna go through this year, BippyBuy Amazons 3-pack with one bottle of each brand, and youll be set -- and confused -- for life.Angostura Orange Bitters happen to be very good.;;2013-01-09T06:00:00Z;;1586.0;280.0
Wheat Beers Best Friend;a single drop in the glass before you pour a wheat beer (belgian style) does the job much better than a slice of orange. the flavor hit is pure aromatic orange without the nasty taste of the pith.failed experiments included:*more than one drop: over the top*in a glass of budmillcoor lite: weirdly bitter and flavorless at the same time*in a trappist ale: puts the beer out of balanceLynn Hoffman, author The Short Course in Beer;;;;1587.0;280.0
GREAT Quality at a GREAT price;Bitters have been so strong in the craft-cocktail scene these days, and we are always searching for the best quality and flavors to put behind our bar. This version of Angostura Bitters (Orange) contributes a wonderfully tart and sweet hint to any drink. We are incredibly happy with the results that have been shown when using these. The Price point on this bottle wins all the starts however, as our wholesale purveyors carry the same product for about 5 higher than Amazons list-price.;;2012-02-16T06:00:00Z;;1588.0;280.0

They are great for charms but you should know a couple of things;I purchased these to make charms. They work fine, but if you are using them for this purpose you should know they have a plastic liner. I didnt see that in the description and didnt think about it till thy were received. You can peel off the liner but its a nuisance. Also, I use a Sizzix Big Kick to flatten. At first they were going complete flat and distorted into ovals. After several frustrating attempts, I realized I was using an extra shim from a previous project. If you use just the base plate and the 2 cutting plates, they will turn out perfectly. Also, they cut deep and will stick to the cutting plate but will pop out very easily. My plates are already pretty shot, so I will probably keep using them just for the bottle caps and get new ones for my other projects.;;2015-12-06T00:00:00Z;;1602.0;285.0

im happy with product;ive only used a few yeasts in my day for making wine, cider, and mead and ive never found much difference in taste depending on yeast. i started my latest hooch two days ago and id like to say ive never had a more active batch. in a 1 gallon carboy or in my 5gal bucket the airlocks are going nuts, very active little buggers they are.;;2015-01-30T00:00:00Z;;1606.0;288.0
Love this yeast!;I use it for apfelwein (google edworts apfelwein for the recipe). The standard for apfelwein is montrachet, but I find that the cote des blancs ferments out a little dryer, while leaving a cleaner overall flavor and a bit of lingering sweet sensation on your tongue. Costs 1/pack at my local homebrew store, and stays good in the fridge for a couple years, so no point in not buying in bulk.;;;;1607.0;288.0
Highly recommend!!;I love this it has become my go to for white, and blush brews. There is virtually no foam at all, just a little bubbling. I used this with pear, the final product was so wonderfully aromatic, and the taste was superb. It made you just want to drink glass after glass of it. There was a nice level of alcohol as well, about 9-10. However, I made 6 gallons and only used one package. The instructions say one package will do up to 5 gallons so if I had used two I would probably have gotten a higher alcohol percentage. Nevertheless, even with one package it was wonderful.;;2014-01-21T00:00:00Z;;1608.0;288.0

A little slow, but very effective for many white wines.;I used this to make apple wine and it was marvelous. It worked very well and didnt have a yeasty flavor at all. It can be a little slow to start, but that is likely because I wasnt using it for the intended purpose. If youre looking for a long-lasting, simple, affordable yeast for white wines of any type, this will keep you happy.It is worth noting that each packet is enough for 5 gallons worth of wine so long as you give it sufficient time to ferment.;;2014-07-29T00:00:00Z;;1610.0;288.0

Perfect for your lighter wines, ciders;Nice fresh yeast. This brand has always performed exceptionally, and we have never had a dud. It doesnt impart harsh yeasty flavors to your fermentables.

Mildly spicy mustard;This mustard came as a Christmas stocking stuffer. Ive tried various spicy mustards over the years in hope I would find the perfect mustard. Some have been really good, some not quite so good. And to some extent what I want depends on what sort of mood Im in and what Im putting the mustard on. I have come to really like this Alstertor mustard. It has a pleasant taste without being overwhelming. Although I consider it a fairly mild mustard, it is stronger (and nicer) than a typical dijon mustard. At the same time it doesnt have the astringency of certain mustards that heavily emphasize the horseradish. I have found it to be a great complement to large soft pretzels. It also works pretty well with a not overly spiced sausage as well. And I like the little mug. As a home brewer Ive often thought it would be nice to have a mug like this when I wanted to sample my beer.;;;;703.0;289.0

Good mustard, but overpriced!;I purchased this mustard based on the reviews. I am not disappointed in the taste however, I am in the packaging and the price. First, the tape used to hold the lid down was not as pictured nor was it very secure. The date code on the side of the lid is worn off where I cannot read the month or day...only the year, which is 2013. The price at 8.49 is about 5-6 too high. I have found it at MyBrands, which is the importers site for public sale, at 2.25 and elsewhere for 3 and up. I think the 8.49 price has the free shipping built in.

Love the Jar;I love the jar becuase I love touching my lips and I love the idea of being able to control the amount of Carmax you want on your finger. The Jar is also most ideal when wanting to share with friends and family as you dont have to worry about their lips touching your stick. Each person gets their own individual amount. The Jar is the best! ALSO if you happen to get a cold sore you dont have to scrape of the top layer on the stick wasting product as to prevent the cold sore from coming back and spreading.

Prevents and Treats Dry, Chapped Skin;I use this product particularily in the cold winter months, and it does a great job of protecting my lips from the weather.

Under lipcolor during the day, generously on my lips as a conditioning treatment during the night, and on the skin Near my nose when Im sick that gets dried and irritated from blowing my nose. This product works and is a budget-friendly staple For anyones makeup collection.

Nothing wrong with original!;I usually always buy Carmex when it comes to lip balm and the original jar is one of my go-to Carmex products. I do love the cherry and tubes but the jar is very convenient to have around, and less likely to lose! It lasts forever as well! I apply it every day, multiple times a day and it still looks like I havent made a dent in the product after a month! It keeps my lips moisturizer for hours and doesnt leave a greasy residue or doesnt feel sticky like other lip balms do. highly recommend this to keep at your desk for work or in your purse!;5.0;2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;2522.0;290.0
Addictive must have.;I know people claim that Carmex is addictive, and I know that you claim its not. Either way, I love it. I slather virtually half of my face with it prior to bed each night (I dont wear it during the day, because I dont like feeling the least bit greasy). Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that I love Carmex. I once forgot to bring my Carmex with me on business trip, and I was stuck buying an over-priced ChapStick in a hotel lobby. And boy, is that stuff junk. It felt like I was spreading old cheese on my lips. This is an any day must have.;5.0;2015-09-23T00:00:00.000Z;False;2523.0;290.0

Carmex- It made your first kiss perfect;I have been using Carmex in its familiar pot since high school. I remember it like yesterday. The girls gathered in the ladies room between classes to gossip, giggle, brush our hair and put on Carmex to soften our lips. We had to be ready just in case the cute boy we crushed on spoke to us. We wouldnt be kissing in class, but, we followed the ritual so our lips would be perfect. I still love the feeling of it on my lips and taking that 1st inhale, that makes your lips tingle and your thoughts travel to a sweet memory.;5.0;2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z;False;2527.0;290.0
great for in night stand;I love keeping a jar at home for use before bed or if I need it during the night. I also keep a jar for each of my kids especially during the winter, when lips get chapped the most. They lick their lips and cause that ring around the mouth that this product helps get rid of fast. They keep theirs by their beds in case they need it during night also. I like the how smooth it is and the scent is also very pleasant!

Awesome Product!;I remember back when I was a small child, my father would always be on my case about putting Carmex on my lips because they were always so sore and chapped. Of course a 7 year old wouldnt care... Until the winter came. My lips were so chapped and I started getting cold sores all over my mouth. So I finally listened to my dad about putting Carmex on my lips. Ever since I started , I never stopped. Carmex Is such an amazing product !

THE Best Lip Balm;I began using Carmex in high school. I had really bad acne and started an acne treatment that really dried my face and lips out. The dermatologist told me to use Carmex. I am now 50 years old and I still use it. I have to put it on in the morning after applying my makeup, and reapply several times throughout the day. Then after I have removed my makeup for the night and right before I go to bed, I reapply. I cannot go to sleep without it. My husband uses it almost as much as I do. Excellent product.

I cant wait for the smell of the jar.;When I open a jar of Carmex. I cant wait for the cooling smell it has. Soft as butter, goes on like silk. Protects my lips from wind, rain, and sun. I wear it to sleep to keep my lips moist and supple. I even use it in my nose when the house is dry to keep it loose and soft. I think Carmex is the best on the market. Low in price, high in quality. Ive used it for many years. When my kids were little I would use it for cold sores and chapped lips and cheeks. Keep up the excellent work.

Old School;Ive been using the pot Carmex since the 70s! I have loved it all these years! Back in the day anyone we were with would say, can I use your Carmex It was the only lip protection referred to. Someone always had Carmex on them.

I actually got a cold sore yesterday 8/31 and its gone today. I told my daughter about it a while back because she had a sore and she even used it.

Original Carmex Design;Im going to do a review on the 1st product made by Carmex, because this one is the first one I have ever tried. Its what got me hooked on this Lip Balm where it all started. I tried this product when I was 12 years old, my lips were so chapped that it was so painful and red. As soon as my aunt and uncle purchased it for me, it stopped my pain right away and within a couple of days, it was gone. I have never had a problem with this product and as of today I still carry Carmex in my purse. A+ for this product made by Carmex and its affordable. Thank you for making my life easier.

Great Lip Balm;Ive been using Carmex for the past two years. This product keeps your lips moist and smooth. I got to say that before I started using Carmex I normally used to get cold sores and other cold sore products did not help at all. I tried all of them, like Abreva and spent so much money on products like that and my cold sores took a long time to heal or got worse. My friend told me about Carmex, so I tried Carmex when I had the sores and I it was amazing how my sore was diminishing and was gone so quickly. I always keep Carmex in my bag, dresser, in my car. Definitely would recommend this product to friends and family.;5.0;2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z;False;2541.0;290.0
great product;I am prone to severe chapped lips. If I dont use chap stick every day my lips dry out to the point that they crack and bleed. Unlike most chap sticks which work for a few hours then need to be reapplied (every 2 or 3 hours) the Carmex jar is long lasting. I can put it on twice a day (before work and before bed) and my lips are fine sometimes I can even get do fine using it just once a day if the weather isnt harsh. If its really cold or dry I still only need to use chap stick mid-day once when I use the carmex morning and night, which is a vast improvement. I love it. Added bonus the jar is my favorite color.;5.0;2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z;False;2542.0;290.0
Smooth soft lips!;I bought my carmex jar about a month or so ago because I live in Georgia and its so easy to get dry lips with this hot, dry weather! So, I decided to try it out! After one week my boyfriend and I both noticed changes and my lips are so soft now! He however doesnt like carmex do to the oily feeling and the taste to him is rather undelightful. However one day I left my jar in the car by accident and when I came back it was melted! The hear from outside actually fully melted it! But after bringing it inside it came right back to life and have had no problems with it. I was rather happy about that!;5.0;2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z;False;2543.0;290.0

Amazing lip product;I have used carmex for many years but for a while i had forgot about it and it got pushed to the back of a draw. however recently i found it and remembered how moisturising it is on the lips and that great tingly minty feeling the balm gives you. i always have dry chapped lips but using carmex has allowed my lips to heal and make them feel soft. now i could not live with out it i have a jar in all of my bags and around my house and apply it multiple times a day and before bed i apply a generous amount to work as a lip mask over night to give me luscious lips in the morning.;5.0;2015-12-29T00:00:00.000Z;False;2546.0;290.0
Invigorating healing power;I am a lifelong Carmex user. Not only does it keep my lips from drying and cracking during the searing summer months and frigid winter months, but when I used to play in the marching band, it was an indispensable tool I would never go without. Playing a wind instrument in extreme weather conditions can be murder on your lips but Carmexs invigorating healing power kept my lips fresh, safe, and protected - even under the most punishing conditions. It doesnt wear off easily like some other brands and you can actually feel it healing your lips immediately.This stuff works miracles!;5.0;2015-09-15T00:00:00.000Z;False;2547.0;290.0
Best product out there;Ive used this product in the pot for over 20 yrs til it came out in a tube, Ive used the tube ever since. Ive tried everything on the market and nothing works like it does. I still dont like the smell or flavor but Im hooked. Ive tried the cherry and didnt care for it at all. Have you every thought about vanilla or mint in the tube Because I find the vanilla in the stick to be the right smell/flavor but I dont like the texture and it doesnt last like the original on your lips. Thank you I have tube all over my house and everywhere I go. If not I have to stop and buy some.;5.0;2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z;False;2548.0;290.0

I always keep afresh one handy.;I discovered Carmex Original Lip Balm more than ten years ago. Since then Ive never used a different brand. The soothing difference is like night day. I am constantly recommending Carmex lip balm to all my friends even acquaintances that display an immediate need to get some relief from chapped lips cold sores, as I know beyond a reasonable doubt that I end up a Hero! Without exception they love it, too cant believe theyve just discovered it. I always have an unopened/unused tube with me that I then give to the newest convert! The love is overwhelming!

wonderfully healthy lips!;Ive exclusively used carmex for 36 yrs! Its the last thing i do before going to bed at night! My lips have not been chapped once in all those years! There soft and supple always! I prefer the original pot over all the other Carmex, not only is it on my bedside table but in my purse, its always with me! Ive three daughters that use it before going to sleep at night, and it is with them everyday of the year also! All I can say is that it is simply the best lip product ever!!! I recommend it always when someone has chapped or dry lips or just want smooth soft lips always!;5.0;2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;2551.0;290.0
Lucky;You dont know how lucky you are to have carmex lip balm in a jar..... I came to Texas from miles away to find lips here are spoiled every day.

Not to fear tho carmex lip balm in a jar, cuz everyone here knows who you are! Just ask and you will see who has that balm takes only seconds and its in YOUR lucky little palm!

Helping Lips Heal - Healthy Happy!;This is the ONLY product that heals cold sores completely! I had never had a cold sore before, but a few weeks ago, there it was. I went to the pharmacy and bought an expensive medicine specifically for cold sores. Not only did it not work, but actually made my lips itchy. As I have been using Carmex for years for my dry and chapped lips, I thought, okay, Ill give it a try on this cold sore! Like magic, its gone! This is a phenomenal product, and I am super grateful to the people at Carmex for consistently making high quality products. From my lips I say, THANK YOU!;5.0;2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z;False;2553.0;290.0
Super Restorative;I found this product back in the 1980s. I walked into my local drug store looking for something that would work better on chapped lips fever blisters. My go to was Chap Stick before finding Carmex. I found Carmex to be so soothing restorative for my lips. I use it under lipstick or by itself everyday. For me, it keeps fever blisters manageable if I get one. Super moisturizing in any weather. I never leave home without one form of it in my pocket or handbag. This lip balm jar is my go to now before bed. Please never change your product, it works it works well!!;5.0;2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;2554.0;290.0
I always wondered why...;My sisters used to use this all the time! They ran through jar upon jar of it as I was growing up! Considering I was a good 10 years younger than them, I just thought they were weird teenagers, but when I turned 14, I was on the swim team at school, and the other girls were using it for their chapped lips, we had horribly dry lips due to the constant lap swimming we did in all weather 4 times a week, and after 3 days we had amazing lips! This stuff is the real deal! The girls who didnt use Carmex were looking a little raw faced at our trials, we used it even on our cheeks to help with windburn, and it was phenomenal for elbows too! It really does work for everything, and now I know why we had so many empty tiny yellow jars everywhere!;5.0;2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;2555.0;290.0

Not the same as the original...;When I bought the new carmex thats in a pkg, rather than how they used to sell it in an open box..I noticed that it went up in price. Not a big deal, since that happens with time, everything seems to go up. But what I was upset about was that, even though it looks like the same jar, if you look underneath, the indentation goes up so far, that it is about half of what you used to get. I have an old glass jar, and compared to the new plastic one, the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up! Now Ive noticed the ones that are not in pkgs, have a tight plastic sticker on the bottom to cover up that fact. I havent bought any carmex since. I was going to email the company, but they sent me an email to review their product.;3.0;2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;2557.0;290.0
Nothing but the best.;I have been using this for at least 3 and a half decades. and love it to death, my only complaint is that I actually miss the old glass containers it came in.

You cannot go wrong with this!;Let me first start by saying that I have suffered from severe chapped lips for as long as I can remember. I literally layers of skin peeling off from my lips little by little. Suffice to say, it can be quite painful. While I visited my doctor, I brought up my issue and he commanded Carmex. I was a bit skeptical but I went for it anyways. I have tried so many remedies before to no avail...so why not another attempt...Well, let me tell you this is my very last attempt because Carmex has improved my condition tremendously. It is not only soothing and moisturizing but helped with the peeling and the chapped lips. Now my lips are baby soft, supple and stays hydrated for long hours. I could not ask for a better lip balm!;5.0;2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z;False;2560.0;290.0
Wonder balm!!;My wife bought this cream a few month ago and to be honest I was under the impression that it would be like all the other balms. Oh boy was I wrong! This little wonder balm is the cure to my chapped limps and the cure to my cold sores. YES cold sores. In fact it beats all other cold sore medication out there. When I use regularly, meaning I dont lose my jar like I often do, it prevents chapped lips and cold sores from reappearing. Plus I love the tingling sensation you get after you apply it. I recommend it to all my friends. Now that I found this product, my pharmacy does not carry it anymore. Now I have to find another place to get it! With the help of the website I think I found a solution. Thank you CARMEX.;5.0;2015-12-04T00:00:00.000Z;False;2561.0;290.0
MY FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD;Ever since I was little I have used carmex as my go-to chapstick. I love everything about it and I could never find a better lip balm. Its not just something to put on your lips when your lips are dry it also works wonders if your lips are cracked or hurting from being too dry. This product is a must have in your purse at all times!

The Original Smooth;I purchased this delightful little jar approximately two weeks ago, in preparation for the impending winter months, and the inevitably chapped and cracked lips. In the vast world we all live in today, we are often overwhelmed by the HUGE number of choices we are faced with every day, even when it comes to something as simple as which chap stick we want to purchase. I cant thank Carmex enough for forever making this little choice easier for me by creating a lip balm that is by and far above the rest. Their simple yet elegant design combined with their no nonsense, get the job done formula make this the obvious choice for anyone looking to have healthy, happy lips throughout the holiday season.;5.0;2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z;False;2563.0;290.0
Unlike any other lip remedy!;My lips are almost ALWAYS chapped without Carmex. Ive had dry and chapped lips for so long and Ive tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an instinctual urge and I dont think Ive ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. Theyre so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. Ive found with Lucas Pawpaw, its only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesnt absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. Ive only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me. I really love my little tub of Carmex and its by far one of the best lip remedies Ive picked up - at such an affordable price as well!;5.0;2015-09-20T00:00:00.000Z;False;2564.0;290.0
CARMEX LIPBALM;I was introduced to this product back in the 80s and this is yet by far the BEST product that I have used and will ever use. It keeps my lips moist and supple. I go out of my way when my pharmacy that I shop does not have my product. However I have learned now for years is to STOCK up, and that is exactly what I do. Thanks to CARMEX for this unique and exquisite product. Id love to be entered into a commercial if youd allow me. (SMILE)! I recommend this to all I encounter. Lastly, you have gotten a bit expensive and really there was no need.

Since 1979;I started using carmex when I moved back home to Chicago in 1979. A co-worker at the Hospital turned me onto Carmex. She told me it was a staple for Winters in Chicago. I have used it ever since and I live in the Southeast now. Its not just good for sore chapped winter lips its perfect for surfing, a lipstick base or gloss, or just dry lips. Believe me, just ask my Hubby, I have jars in all my cars and my purses and stashed everywhere so its always handy. Ive traveled the World with my Original Carmex in the jar. Carmex has been with me to Mexico, Jamaica, the Bahamas, and all over the USA.

Familiar Friend;My mom would always keep this jar of Carmex stocked in our bathrooms and nothing else was used in our house. Well, I am all grown up now and I had run out of my beloved Carmex in a jar. Hubby came home with some other brand that was immediately thrown in the trash. He obviously did not understand my love for the familiar soothing scent, the way it immediately took care of my dry lips and the yellow cover with the white pot. I found it in the store. Picked up five.Checked out, in the car, tore into one of those wrappers, opened one of those pots and that familiar friend was back!!

Spending the afternoon w/ my grandmother, she stopped at a local pharmacy to buy me a tube of ChapStick the pharmacist helping her suggested that we try a new aid handed her a little yellow tin tub of Carmex suggested we try it! I used it non-stop for the next few days, and AMAZED my whole family w/ how well FAST Carmex did the job!!!!! I have used NOTHING ELSE ever since! My lips belong SOLELY to Carmex!!!!!

MAKES THE WORLDS SOFTEST LIPS!!!;I have been an avid user of Carmex in the pot for the last 40 years!! I was living in Wisconsin when I started using this product in high school in the 70s. I then moved to Florida and they did NOT have Carmex in the state of Florida. I was distraught and had to have my mother send me shipments of carmex so I could survive. I have a pot of carmex in every room of my house, my car, my purses -- EVERYWHERE!!! I have tried all of the other lip products out there and the ONLY one I find absolutely reliable everytime is Carmex. My lips have stayed so soft for so many years and I never have chapped lips.

Always comes through for me!;I have used Carmex Original Lip Balm, in the little round jar, for many years and it has always come through for me! There are not many products out there, that I have found, that work consistently and do exactly what they claim to do, but this one does. At the first hint of a cold sore, I grab the Carmex as quickly as I can. and apply it. It stops the cold sore from progressing and heals what is trying to pop out. If I cant find my little jar, I panic and hurry to the store to buy another one. (No one wants to go around with an ugly cold sore!)

Silky texture and smoothest effect.;I got my Carmex the first time I started having really chapped lips and it works wonder when taking this acne medication called Roaccutane which causes lips to be dehydrated. The orange flavor liquid lip conditioning tube has worked wonders for me these days, I also used the original jar but right now I dont remember where I put it so I havent used it. From what I remember it has a nice refreshing scent and also calms your lips from burning due to the extreme dryness.;4.0;2016-09-19T00:00:00.000Z;False;2572.0;290.0
Amazing;So I recently moved from Pennsylvania to Colorado. Huge elevation difference. A few days ago, a friend and I went to Garden of the Gods and I failed to bring chapstick. The result was me linking my lips WAY too much and I suffered tremendously the next day. My lips were on fire. The day after that, my lips were SO severely chapeed, I didnt even want to go to work. Well, of course I went, and I bought this little miracle in a jar. Within just a few hours, my lips were 80 better. Still chapped as they needed to heal but I was so shocked at how quickly Carmex soothed my lips. Amazing. I love it.;5.0;2016-04-28T00:00:00.000Z;False;2573.0;290.0

What a nice surprise!;Somehow I found this balm in Romania, in a little store. I decided to buy it, the jar was so interesting, the price was good, too, but I must admit, my expectations werent very high. I have a lot of lip balms, and none of them really works. And then... such a big surprise! The menthol, the camphor... these arent very usual for lip balms, but they did a good job with my lips, together with the other ingredients. It became my favourite balm in the world! I would be sooo happy to try the other products, but, unfortunately, its impossible to buy these from here, and to bring them from the USA its too expensive.;5.0;2016-10-14T00:00:00.000Z;False;2575.0;290.0

OMG! best lip balm ever!;I am in love with this lip balm. the original pot version. i love the way it makes my lips feel. it makes them feel fresh, smooth, soft. This is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips. other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy, this doesnt. its like a miracle in a jar. i never get cold sores, but i use this like an everyday lip balm. it is wonderful. if you like wearing lipstick, and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips, put some of this on your lips while your getting ready, then wipe it of and apply lipstick. i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar. carmex has the perfect texture. the smell is like the original chapstick smell. lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby dolls skin. kind of powdery in a way, but i like it. its so cheap. only 99 cents at my walmart. so worth buying. you wont be disappointed. you can also use it on dry hands as well. its long lasting too.;5.0;2012-11-29T00:00:00.000Z;False;2577.0;290.0

I would not use anything else, but...;I have been using Carmex since the 80s when my mother introduced me to it. I in turn introduced it to my husband, he cannot do without it. Due to his addiction we probably keep 10 -15 jars stashed around the house and in the cars. One on each side of the bed, one in the bathroom, one in each of our cars. There is always at least 1 in the laundry room (freshly laundered) 2-3 in his desk drawer and a couple of brand new ones, just in case. My only disappointment was the day I went to buy an new jar and the package felt different... My beloved jar was now plastic. My little wonderfully feeling porcelain (I believe) jar was gone, I have to admit, that month I searched for my beloved jar in every store I went, in the hopes that they had not sold out of them, only to be replaced by the new plastic jar. I dont know about anyone else, but I would gladly pay an uncharge to have my beloved and true Classic Original Jar back once again.;5.0;2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z;False;2580.0;290.0

Using it before I could spell it!;I have been using Carmex Original Lip Balm in the jar since I was a child. I remember my Mom getting out the little tub of Carmex putting on my lips before I went out the door, winter, spring, summer, or fall. When I was a teen there would always be a little jar in my Christmas stocking along with a tube now that I wanted to wear lip gloss. I never went to lip gloss, just my Carmex. As my own daughters came I would put a little Carmex on their lips before they left the house too...they got a little tub in their Christmas stockings. Now I have granddaughters who get a little Carmex on their lips before they go out from me their Moms! They also get a little jar flavored tubes in their Christmas stockings... all these years later at 60 yrs old its still my go to lip quencher season after season a Christmas stocking favorite!;5.0;2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z;False;2585.0;290.0
Service in a combat zone;It was in Annasiriya, Iraq That I was introduced to Carmex and have been a true believer ever since. We were pulling security at the Ziggurat of UR while the Iraqis had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance. We were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day I had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip. A fellow soldier suggested Carmex. I was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns. Since that time, May 2003, I returned to southern Iraq in 2009 and spent January 2011 to February 2013 in Kandahar Province Afghanistan, and every time I took a good supply of Carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area.I told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some Carmex.;5.0;2015-09-15T00:00:00.000Z;False;2586.0;290.0

Carmex Yellow Capped Jars A Wisconsin Tradition!;Im from a generation of Wisconsin families who have had Carmex Original Lip Balm Jars faithfully in their pocket, purse, backpack, and bathroom for over 40 years. From harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun, along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between, Carmex has relieved it all. From the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened, to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you, and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application...its happiness to my senses! I use it instead of lipstick for a natural shine several times throughout the day, and at night before bedtime to avoid chapped/dry lips. The Carmex Original Lip Balm Jar will continue to be one of my Wisconsin traditions that Ill highly recommend to my family and friends!;5.0;2015-09-03T00:00:00.000Z;False;2589.0;290.0
A Must Have!;I have always gotten horrific fever blisters and tried everything to soothe them - if youre not aware, they are very painful - anyways, a friend of mine asked me if I had ever tried Carmex and I hadnt and had honestly given up hope that anything would ever work. So, I was out at my local drug store and seen the Carmex and picked up a jar as a last ditch effort - boy, was I so glad that I did! Carmex has been a life saver for me. I know that sounds shallow, but its the truth. I felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the Carmex soothed them. Needless to say, I have jars and tubes of Carmex every where in my house, car, purses, etc. You can never have enough. I use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected.

Bless you;My lips always keep super dry during the winter regardless of how much water I drink. Ive gone THREE DAYS with chap, awful lips and finally remembered to pick up Carmex. It never lets me down. Im sitting here now with soft, soothed lips and it reminds me of how when youre super sick as a child and your mom comforts you. Normal chapstick never does the job.

A Classic To Keep!;I remember when I first was introduced to Carmex, my mother put it on our chapped lips in the winter. I remember the tingling feeling on my lips and I loved it. I still use it today, and when friends ask me what do I use, instead of the usual chapstick or whatever else most people use, I always say Carmex because it works well. Its actually the only lipcare that I use--also perfect as a base before I put on lipstick. It just absolutely works. Thats it.

Service in a combat zone;It was in Annasiriya, Iraq That I was introduced to Carmex and have been a true believer ever since. We were pulling security at the Ziggurat of UR while the Iraqis had their very first meeting at an attempt at self governance. We were in the hot sun all day and at the end of the day I had a blister on my lip that looked like a cigarette had been put out on my lip. A fellow soldier suggested Carmex. I was given some and it worked like a charm healing this burn and preventing any more burns. Since that time, May 2003, I returned to southern Iraq in 2009 and spent January 2011 to February 2013 in Kandahar Province Afghanistan, and every time I took a good supply of Carmex that saved my lips from burning from the extreme sun found in the area.I told everyone that if they wanted to send me a care package to please send some Carmex.;;;False;2586.0;290.0
OMG! best lip balm ever!;I am in love with this lip balm. the original pot version. i love the way it makes my lips feel. it makes them feel fresh, smooth, soft. This is the only lip balm that doesnt irritate my lips. other lip balms and glosses leave my lips numb and itchy, this doesnt. its like a miracle in a jar. i never get cold sores, but i use this like an everyday lip balm. it is wonderful. if you like wearing lipstick, and sometimes have those annoying dry peeling lips, put some of this on your lips while your getting ready, then wipe it of and apply lipstick. i like that its not oily greasy like the blistex in the jar. carmex has the perfect texture. the smell is like the original chapstick smell. lol it kind of reminds me of the smell of a new baby dolls skin. kind of powdery in a way, but i like it. its so cheap. only 99 cents at my walmart. so worth buying. you wont be disappointed. you can also use it on dry hands as well. its long lasting too.;;;False;2577.0;290.0

What a nice surprise!;Somehow I found this balm in Romania, in a little store. I decided to buy it, the jar was so interesting, the price was good, too, but I must admit, my expectations werent very high. I have a lot of lip balms, and none of them really works. And then... such a big surprise! The menthol, the camphor... these arent very usual for lip balms, but they did a good job with my lips, together with the other ingredients. It became my favourite balm in the world! I would be sooo happy to try the other products, but, unfortunately, its impossible to buy these from here, and to bring them from the USA its too expensive.;;;False;2575.0;290.0

Amazing;So I recently moved from Pennsylvania to Colorado. Huge elevation difference. A few days ago, a friend and I went to Garden of the Gods and I failed to bring chapstick. The result was me linking my lips WAY too much and I suffered tremendously the next day. My lips were on fire. The day after that, my lips were SO severely chapeed, I didnt even want to go to work. Well, of course I went, and I bought this little miracle in a jar. Within just a few hours, my lips were 80% better. Still chapped as they needed to heal but I was so shocked at how quickly Carmex soothed my lips. Amazing. I love it.;;;False;2573.0;290.0

Using it before I could spell it!;I have been using Carmex Original Lip Balm in the jar since I was a child. I remember my Mom getting out the little tub of Carmex & putting on my lips before I went out the door, winter, spring, summer, or fall. When I was a teen there would always be a little jar in my Christmas stocking along with a tube now that I wanted to wear lip gloss. I never went to lip gloss, just my Carmex. As my own daughters came I would put a little Carmex on their lips before they left the house too...they got a little tub in their Christmas stockings. Now I have granddaughters who get a little Carmex on their lips before they go out from me & their Moms! They also get a little jar & flavored tubes in their Christmas stockings... all these years later at 60 yrs old its still my go to lip quencher season after season & a Christmas stocking favorite!;;;False;2585.0;290.0

Excellent yeast, not fussy at all;Nice fresh yeast. This brand has always performed exceptionally, and we have never had a dud. It doesnt impart harsh yeasty flavors to your fermentables. We have used this for wine and mead, holds up to higher alcohol, we dont even prime it, we just pitch and the airlocks are bubbling merrily away in a few hours.;;2014-01-07T00:00:00Z;;1612.0;295.0
Great for most red wines;I have been making homemade wine for about eight years and have used the Red Star Pasteur Red Dried Wine Yeast on a number of occasions. I have had excellent results when using this for Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Fermentation has always started quickly and the yeast works fast to produce an alcohol content of somewhere in the 13 range. Moreover, it has worked excellently even when the room temperature hasnt been ideal for making wine. There is no yeasty taste after fermentation. I highly recommend this for full-bodied red wines.;;;;703.0;295.0
Better yeast for red wine;I used this after using Montrachet which had a horrible sulfur smell while fermenting. Much happier with this so far.;;2014-04-02T00:00:00Z;;2686.0;295.0
Great Product, Very Viable, Good Dry Flavor;Made a ginger champagne with this yeast and a few batches of mead. The mead and champagne were both dry and had great flavor (the champagne was super dry).

Elderberry Wine;The package states that the yeast is sufficient for 5 gallons, but Im only doing a gallon at a time. Im also using it for elderberries not grapes. Start to finish is about 8-10 days and the alcohol content is on the mark.;;;;2688.0;295.0

Packs a Punch;I was not able to gage the alcohol content but I can say that it packs a punch. I would say that at the least it is 14-15. In fact, I gave my mom a bottle, she has to mix it with a lower content alcohol (9), and it still knocks her out with one glass. I gave a bottle to another friend and she said that she was ready to sleep after a glass. I did cherries, added raisins clove and 1 cinnamon stick and let it ferment for 4 weeks then removed the fruit and let it set in the fermenter another 3-4 weeks. I will definitely use this again!;;2013-10-17T00:00:00Z;;1608.0;295.0

Best red wine!;I have been drinking this Apothic California Crush for the past six months and find it totally refreshing. It is so smooth and flavorable. One bottle is usually not enough and I tend to buy six bottles at a time. Fortunately the price in Alaska is much cheaper which makes it even more desirable!;1.0;2017-01-20T00:00:00Z;;2701.0;297.0
Alright But....;This ointment works fine for dry eye. My only downfall is that it has a metal tip applicator. If it were plastic like the other similar products then I would give it 5 stars.;3.0;2013-09-05T02:50:34.000Z;;276.0;298.0
Very good horseradish mustard;I stumbled across this a few years ago, and now its all we use when we can buy it. Great on hot dogs, brats, and the like. Its great to find out that we can order for store pick-up at Walmart. We would highly recommend to anyone that likes a little more kick than normal yellow mustard. To be clear, it is not too spicy at all. We think it is outstanding.;5.0;2017-06-11T00:00:00.000Z;False;2703.0;299.0

FANTASTIC;I brought the rose and cab. I just opened the rose and it was just as advertised - not too sweet. Thats the reason I dont drink roses they are either too dry or too sweet, however, this was mildly sweet and not dry at all and VERY SMOOTH. GETTING READY TO DO AUTO SHIP. Im a wine snob and yet I would serve this to a group and my personal wine connoisseur.;5.0;;;2707.0;300.0
Incredible wines;I purchased the 12 Bottle Harvest Collection several weeks ago at the insane low price of $99.00!! I tried the Pinot Noir last night and it was fantastic!!

I have unclouded fruit/veggie wines!;I had my doubts when I purchased this stuff, and confess to only buying it to be able to follow a recipe verbatim. But I am very impressed. I made a carrot wine, and decided to use a juicer instead of slicing and soaking in sugar to extract the juices. Using a juicer also extracts the pectin. I was going to deal with a cloudy wine since itll taste the same anyway. I added a teaspoon of this Pectic Enzyme to every gallon of my mash, and to my surprise, it worked! I had a very thick and cloudy wine after the first racking, but now that the wine has had its second racking and has been fermenting for nearly three months, it is a beautiful clear orange color, with no cloudy qualities to note! Now that Im a believer, I use it in all of my white or lighter colored wines, and no matter the extraction method I use, Im getting a nice, clear wine a few months later.;;2014-10-18T00:00:00Z;;2709.0;302.0

Reasonable Value;Has worked wonders when using fresh fruit. I usually add a little more than the package says to speed things along, but I dont notice a taste or texture difference, even when adding extra later in the process for homebrew. Can be sticky when wet so best poured in with a dry funnel.;;2015-01-06T00:00:00Z;;2711.0;302.0
I use this to break down fruit;Its just another product youd want to use when you need to break down the fruit for fermentation. If that is your goal, then this is what you need.;;2013-04-20T00:00:00Z;;2712.0;302.0

Very happy;Ive purchased Barefoot Cellars many times and this sampler was a great buy! The price was perfect and getting a chance to sample a little bit of everything is even better. My package came boxed very well and in my set I received a bottle of Pinot Grigio Champagne (saving for special occasion). I had a glass of the Chardonnay last night with dinner and it was so refreshing. Ive had a variety of whites and have tried to find something that I could have with a nice meal or alone (I am not a fan of white wines), but this one was perfect! Definitely could have a glass of this alone while reading a good book.;5.0;2016-03-08T00:00:00Z;;2722.0;304.0
Christmas Made Easy...;Getting Christmas presents to friends and family in the USA (from the UK) can be frustrating.

not the best;I have purchased this wine with various cheaper brands and have liked it FAR more. Seemed very sour to me. Not mellow at all. PLUS, they did not mention that you need to sign for this wine during the presentation. Just they now deliver to PA. I found this out while tracking . My luck I was home the day of delivery. Will go to the local state store for my regular brand.;1.0;;;2738.0;306.0
Too Sweet!;I was so happy to see Rose lincluded in this set instead of sweet Zinfandel. Unfortunately this rose was sweeter than Zinfandel. Very disappointed!;2.0;;;2739.0;307.0
Worth Exactly What I Paid...;This wine is not great, in my opinion. I know wine taste is subjective, and this is only my opinion. But to me the wines are harsh, not smooth.

Ok, but not what I was looking for.;It my quest to find an equivalent to Stoneys Ginger Beer that is only available in South Africa, this wasnt exactly what I was searching for, but wasnt bad.

Decent wines that help out some great causes!;I have tried the Cabernet and the Merlot. When I received these I followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping, and then to open and let sit in order to breathe. I felt the Cabernet was still to young, it had a very strong bite to it. I dont consider myself an expert, but I know a wine I like and have been taught a lot and am still learning. The Merlot on the other hand was much better! It was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins. I would continue buying this one. I have not tried the Pinot Noir yet. Im hoping this will be just as satisfying as the Merlot was. I will add to my review once Ive opened the bottle. And most of all I love how this company takes some of the proceeds and gives them to wonderful causes. That alone is worth buying this!;4.0;2015-08-16T00:00:00Z;;2759.0;310.0

Not just a great wine!;Ordering this wine was the first time I had ever ordered wine online, and I wasnt sure if I would really like the wines or not. Well I LOVED all of them, even though I am not a huge fan of pinot noirs. I really like that this company donates a percentage of each wine purchased to a different charity.

Disappointing. Sweet!;I almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines. We pretty much couldnt even drink them because they are so sweet, thick and jammy. Like fruit juice. We started with the Pinot Noir and after a few sips, aerating and then a few more sips with dinner, we just poured it out. It did not resemble any Pinot Ive had before. So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I havent tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned. Unfortunately, I thats not an option since they are open and mail order. Maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking. I do love that this producer gives back to charities, more companies should follow their lead in that respect.;2.0;2016-05-16T00:00:00Z;;2766.0;310.0

Deep Rich Excellent;Love this deep rich but not sweet wine. My first taste was few months ago while visiting relatives in Copperhill, Tennessee. I was surprised with the wonderful, smooth taste and flavors, and happy to learn it was a California wine. Upon returning to Calfornia I ordered a case and shared this delicious hearty smooth wine with friends. Apothic also makes a red wine that is not dark, it to is a smooth flavorful wine but not as rich and deep as the dark, it goes great with everything or nothing. Enjoy, Christina;5.0;2016-03-21T00:00:00Z;;2778.0;311.0

Decent;I have tried the cab and it is acceptable for what I wanted - an after work glass of wine. Put the Pinot away as it is way too young to drink. The rose was refreshing. I have not tried the Chardonnay yet. This group of wines worked for me in that 1) it was about the price of grocery store wine, 2) it was delivered to my house, and 3) I get to try a variety of wines that I normally would not purchase. I marked that I would not recommend this as a gift only because everyones palate is different - I do not usually give wine as a gift.;4.0;;;2787.0;315.0
Great Wine for all food types or by itself!;I have been waiting for this bundle. As the presentation indicated the Rose is not that over bearing sweet, just in the middle and therefore I can enjoy it also, along with the delicious Pino Noir my favorite and the Chardonnay. These are delicious with a meal, by themselves or with cheese - as David says, everything is better with cheese.. I have on Auto- delivery. I wish I could pre-order for next year too.. Very Smooth wine. Everything they said in the presentation with David and other hosts are spot ON! I am enjoying this bundle and you will too.. Thank you QVC and Vintage Wine Estates. Sincerely,;5.0;;;2788.0;315.0
WINES were TERRIBLE, QVC was GREAT!!;"I bought 2 of the wine collections; one in the mixed of white & red and one in the all reds. The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we arent even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. Im giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!! No hassles, questions, etc... just immediately refunded the 2 payments I already made. While the wines disappointed, QVC did not! Thank you QVC, this is exactly why I will remain a loyal shopper!!";2.0;;;2789.0;315.0
Very disappointed;I consider myself a wine lover but I’m not a wine snob. I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites. After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case. You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Lessons learned in this case.;2.0;;;2790.0;315.0
Disappointed;Got this for the nice variety it offered. Rose is nice, not too sweet not too dry. Pinot noir is average, nothing special or outstanding and I wouldn’t get it again. Chardonnay is awful— maybe just the bottle we opened, but it immediately smelled spoiled and tasted the same. Wound up pouring it down the drain and hoping the next two bottles aren’t rotten as well. Have not tried the Cab yet as it’s my favorite type of wine and I hate to be disappointed—hoping we’ll be two for four at least. Sorry to say next time I’ll pass...;3.0;;;2791.0;315.0
Best purchase for the price;We are still sampling each one - so far favorite is the Chardonnay, but that can change;5.0;;;2792.0;315.0
TASTY TASTY;I just received my collection. I opened the Rose and it was very tasty. This Rose is not overly sweet and that was my main concern. It has a light fruity taste and pairs well with cheeses. I havent tasted the others yet, but this is a great deal for the quantity you receive. I will continue to update as I open the others.;5.0;;;2793.0;315.0

Decent but Handle is broken;I love the size and the price on this cooler. However the lower quality than brand name coolers is evident in the finish on this cooler. After about 3 weeks of use the rope handle pulled loose while lifting and the cooler fell to the ground but survived the fall.

OLeary Reds;I bought a case of his reds 6/6 from QVC right before Christmas. I was extremely disappointed with my purchase as were my dinner guests. It is always better to sample a wine before making a purchasing. A lesson learned.;1.0;;;2798.0;317.0

Meritage is perfect blend;I like full bodied but smooth red. The meritage is a perfect blend of the things I love in red wine. Have alternated lately between a Pinot noir and Cab. This is delicious and perfectly priced.;5.0;;;2801.0;319.0
"3 cheers for ""Mr. Wonderful""";I knew that Kevin OLeary loved good wine. Well, let me tell you, he also makes some delicious wine. I purchased the 3-bottle Chardonnay and it is Wonderful. Im no wine expert, but I know what I like. I enjoy white wine but I dont like sweet, which is why I didnt try the Moscato. I like to enjoy a nice glass of white wine whenever I feel like it. This wine is delightful by the glass - no food necessary. Im very pleased with my purchase and even more pleased that I purchased it on auto-delivery. I cant wait for my next shipment! I highly recommend this wine. Mr. Wonderful will not let you down!;5.0;;;2802.0;319.0
BEST RED!!!;I have ordered wines from OLeary before. I love red wine. But THIS red wine is AWESOME!!! More smooth than Cabernet, and Cab is usually my FIRST choice. That was OK but THIS THIS THIS one ... Auto Delivery for sure!!!!;5.0;;;2803.0;319.0
Totally surprised!;Bought the wine for my son for a Christmas present. Was very skeptical at first. First, I myself really dont care for wine. Leaves a nasty after taste and bitter to me, plus after drinking 1 glass of red, I wake up with a severe headache. Well anyway my son open a bottle, I had ordered all red. I went over to see if I could with stand the smell. Totally surprised I could, so I decided to try it. Very smooth, no after taste. Not a strong, bitter smell. Had guests over for New Years eve and they had enjoyed it just as much as I did and my son. Probably will be ordering again.;5.0;;;2804.0;320.0
Not so great blends;Disappointed with the taste and consistency of these wines. My husband and I were looking forward to sharing them with friends on Christmas Eve. We tried the four variety to be fair and were not satisfied planning to send the rest back.;1.0;;;2805.0;320.0

Pleasantly Surprised!;I was a little skeptical about purchasing wine from QVC, but Ive been very surprised by the quality of this wine collection. I ordered the mixed-auto delivery package. The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like youd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that Im a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin OLearys Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). Im so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I cant wait to see what I get in the Spring. Very good wine, Mr. OLeary.;5.0;;;2807.0;320.0
Good wine;I belong to other clubs but bought this because of the free shipping. I do NOT like Rose wine and was sure Id hate it but.......it is excellent. A slight sweet taste very slight. It is a little effervescent too. I forgot where I bought it and googled it to buy more . It runs 75.00 for 3 bottles! Not expensive but not 5.00 a bottle either. I have not had the others but I am anxious to taste them....;4.0;;;2808.0;321.0
Mediocre;You get what you pay for, I got it for $8.25 a bottle and thats about all it is worth. I should of known better. but its free s&h,. I was disappointed its all from the same vintner and not as the labels show different wineries. It was just the ease of delivery. I live in California and have so many options of good wines. One and only purchase. Q does not know good wines!;2.0;;;2809.0;321.0
Our friends loved it!!!;We had four friends over tonight for dinner. They loved this wine! Hands down the Mascato was the favorite!

Good value;I purchased two of these as holiday gifts. The price seemed just right for a bottle of wine, glasses and chocolate. In fact, even without glasses, this wouldve been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I cant speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated lets get naked referring Im sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that. I feel a bit embarrassed now as I hope the recipients dont confuse my intentions. Fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had I sent this to someone more conservative in my life, I would have been so very, very embarrassed.;5.0;2016-12-29T00:00:00Z;;2840.0;327.0

Tastes like a 40+ Cabernet Sauvignon - Not an Oaky Fruit Bomb.;This wine is the best cab for the money Ive ever had. Sometimes a 10 cab tastes like a 20 cab, and thats a bargain wine for sure. This Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Naked Winery drinks like a 40+ cabernet. So try it now! This is not a fruity oak bomb, nor a lengthy, earthy, subtle cab.Here are my 2-liner tasting notes:Black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate.

Good Chardonnay;Ive only tried the chardonnay, so my review is for that wine. I find it very good when chilled properly. I take it out of the refrigerator an hour before drinking it & its perfect. Its not to cold or warm. When drunk too cold, it doesnt have much taste. At the proper temp, it becomes much more complex. It has a clean delicate taste of peach & apricot. Its not a heavy chardonnay. No oak, butter or vanilla undertone. I prefer this crisper, fresher chardonnay. The heavy ones make me gag.;4.0;;;2853.0;328.0

Disappointed;Im not a wine drinker but have relatives and friends who are, so I purchased 12 bottles to have on hand at home and also for gifts. My brother visited this weekend and I opened the red wine for him to enjoy during a football game. He tried to be gracious but finally said it just wasnt good. Now Im wondering what the people thought who received wine as gifts. I have eight bottles left and wondering if I should just pour them down the drain. What a disappointment after the hosts all ooo-ed and ahhh-ed over this supposedly fabulous wine assortment.;1.0;;;2855.0;329.0
Great valued wine;I have order three cases over past two years a great wine for the price point. Other reviews I Have read judge this to harshly.

Not very good;Im not a wine snob but Ive had my fair share of wine over the years. I taste new brands fairly regularly. You can do much better at your local store for the same or less money. Basically tastes like a good box wine. Black Box ... etc.;2.0;;;2866.0;330.0
Excellent value;The Cabernet is a true value. The Chardonnay is also great.;5.0;;;2867.0;330.0
consistently smooth and delicious;We have ordered both white and red sets of OLeary wines more than once, and we have had consistently excellent wine with every single bottle.The sweet wines are delicate and blended perfectly without being too sweet. The rich reds are deep without being too tannic or biting. When we need a wine we can count on to be perfect for guests, or gifts or just enjoying with our everyday meals, this is our go-to wine.We recommend it highly.;5.0;;;2868.0;330.0
Worst Ever;I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I’ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression “rot gut”.;1.0;;;2869.0;330.0
Dont bother...;If youre a selective wine drinker, dont buy this. Its mediocre at best. Will likely end up using for cooking.;1.0;;;2870.0;330.0
Barely average wine;I wish I had returned this wine, but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying. Have ordered Vintage Wine Estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed. OLerarys reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members. Not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what, but just no happy with these and would not order again. Kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable, but there is better wine available at lower cost.;2.0;;;2871.0;330.0
Not Happy With Auto Delivery;"Purchased on auto delivery. First shipment great, second came with 6 bottle of sav but no moscato. We do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles. Third shipment came with the moscato and 3 more sav. Shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment. Moscato is great others are ok. Trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even ""included"" makes it costly. Disappointed.";2.0;;;2872.0;330.0
Good mix;"Im really picky about wine. To be honest, Ive had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance. I actually really really liked the moscato. Moscato is my favorite type of wine and Ive had a lot that I dont care for. If you like Bartenura, you will appreciate this. I liked the white zin also. I didnt care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" Id like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. Id say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who havent heard of the bartenura comparison, its a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as OLeary. If youre curious about this, if say take a chance. Regardless how I feel about the taste of the chardonnay, they are all quite fragrant which I enjoy.";4.0;;;2873.0;330.0
Not what I was hoping for;I purchased the 12 bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage. I usually drink Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. I wish the wines lived up to their descriptions, but sadly they did not. I realize tastes are subjective, but for me, the Chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste. I would not order these again..;2.0;;;2874.0;330.0
Cab is good, Pinot is not;I am a Pinot Noir wine drinker generally, but the Pinot Noir in this case is terrible, even after decanting. Have tried two of the Pinot bottles and a few of each of the others. I actually prefer the Cab over anything in the case and I usually dont like cabs.;2.0;;;2875.0;330.0
Worst Purchase I Have Ever Made!;Cant believe that I was so stupid to fall for Kevin OLearys promotion of his wines. I believed in him, and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety.dozen bottles. What a fool I have been! I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, but I continue to be disappointed. Yes, I know I have a month to return the merchandise! What a laugh!! How to return a huge package? I poured most in the kitchen sink... live and learn.;1.0;;;2876.0;330.0

fine wines;I am more of a dry wine person, but I have enjoyed the chardoney and rose. Not to sweet, not to dry. Great gifts my friends said they enjoyed;5.0;;;2878.0;330.0
I EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR;"I was really hopeful that I would experience a new tasting wine just because its ""Mr. Wonderfuls"" brand. However it was not as flavorful as what I had become accustomed. Its not bad its just okay. I purchased the Zinfandel. I wanted the Moscato but it had sold out. I still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what Im looking to purchase. I would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting.";3.0;;;2879.0;331.0
Not Very Good;I purchased the Pinot Noir and it was terrible. Dumping it and won’t purchase again .;1.0;;;2880.0;331.0
Ordered More Than Once;I only like sweet (not super sweet) wine and the Moscato is absolutely delicious. Im not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings. Ill have it with anything because it tastes that good. Like it before, during, or after dinner. It just tastes great. This is really good wine and the price is good too.;5.0;;;2881.0;331.0
Best Ever;This is the best vine I have ever tasted. I had to reorder me a second round.;5.0;;;2882.0;331.0
Best purchase ever;Very unique tast,I love it you wont go wrong with this;5.0;;;2883.0;331.0
Treat Yourself;I have ordered the set of 12 in the past. I have tried them all and enjoyed allHowever white zinfandel is my favorite. I have given them as gifts with no complaints just compliments. Soooo smooth;5.0;;;2884.0;331.0
Excellent;I only like a sweet wine. I was skeptical on ordering without tasting it first. I am so glad I ordered it. I love it. THANKS KEVIN OLEARY!!!;5.0;;;2885.0;331.0
Delicious !!;I ordered a 3 bottle set of both the Meritage & Moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines. They called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile !! Said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these 3 bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties !! Thanks Kevin & QVC for a hit !!;5.0;;;2886.0;331.0
Sumptuous delicious wine.;I ordered the White Zinfadel in the 3 bottle selection which arrived on Friday. This wine is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. My husband and I visited Nappa Wine Valley and Sonoma Wineries about 3 years ago. Our hats off to Mr. Kevin OLeary to bring such a joy, a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold its own. We had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done. Thank you so much for this wonderful offering.;5.0;;;2887.0;331.0
Excellent Moscato;This was my first purchase of these wines. Tried the Moscato as I like a sweet wine. Found it to be the best Ive ever had. The only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery. Missed the UPS guy a couple times.;5.0;;;2888.0;331.0
OLearys Select Reserve Chardonnay;I dont know why the negative reviews said the wine tasted horrible..? I should have ordered a case! Mr. Wonderful, you have not promised what you havent delivered 10-fold with this wine! I ought to go on auto ship with the case!;5.0;;;2889.0;331.0
