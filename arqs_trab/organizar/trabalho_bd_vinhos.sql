My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads.

I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice.

Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. Its not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). Id purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water.

A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here.

What Ive done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes its that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesnt have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create.

The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers Theyre enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink.

A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regans orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regans. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it.

I havent yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer.

First shipment great, second came with 6 bottle of sav but no moscato. We do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles. Third shipment came with the moscato and 3 more sav. Shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment. Moscato is great others are ok. Trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even \"included\"\" makes it costly. Disappointed.\"'),(2873,330,2873,4,'Good mix','Im really picky about wine. To be honest, Ive had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance. I actually really really liked the moscato. Moscato is my favorite type of wine and Ive had a lot that I dont care for. If you like Bartenura, you will appreciate this. I liked the white zin also. I didnt care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was \"ok.\"\" Id like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. Id say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who havent heard of the bartenura comparison, its a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as OLeary. If youre curious about this, if say take a chance. Regardless how I feel about the taste of the chardonnay, they are all quite fragrant which I enjoy.\"'),(2874,330,2874,2,'Not what I was hoping for','I purchased the 12 bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage. I usually drink Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. I wish the wines lived up to their descriptions, but sadly they did not. I realize tastes are subjective, but for me, the Chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste. I would not order these again..'),(2875,330,2875,2,'Cab is good, Pinot is not','I am a Pinot Noir wine drinker generally, but the Pinot Noir in this case is terrible, even after decanting. Have tried two of the Pinot bottles and a few of each of the others. I actually prefer the Cab over anything in the case and I usually dont like cabs.'),(2876,330,2876,1,'Worst Purchase I Have Ever Made!','Cant believe that I was so stupid to fall for Kevin OLearys promotion of his wines. I believed in him, and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety.dozen bottles. What a fool I have been! I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, but I continue to be disappointed. Yes, I know I have a month to return the merchandise! What a laugh!! How to return a huge package? I poured most in the kitchen sink... live and learn.'),(2869,330,2877,1,'Worst Ever','I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I���ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression ���rot gut���.'),(2878,330,2878,5,'fine wines','I am more of a dry wine person, but I have enjoyed the chardoney and rose. Not to sweet, not to dry. Great gifts my friends said they enjoyed'),(2879,331,2879,3,'I EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR','I was really hopeful that I would experience a new tasting wine just because its \"Mr. Wonderfuls\"\" brand. However it was not as flavorful as what I had become accustomed. Its not bad its just okay. I purchased the Zinfandel. I wanted the Moscato but it had sold out. I still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what Im looking to purchase. I would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting.\"'),(2880,331,2880,1,'Not Very Good','I purchased the Pinot Noir and it was terrible. Dumping it and won’t purchase again .'),(2881,331,2881,5,'Ordered More Than Once','I only like sweet (not super sweet) wine and the Moscato is absolutely delicious. Im not one to drink it with the suggested food pairings. Ill have it with anything because it tastes that good. Like it before, during, or after dinner. It just tastes great. This is really good wine and the price is good too.'),(2882,331,2882,5,'Best Ever','This is the best vine I have ever tasted.

THANKS KEVIN OLEARY!!!'),(2886,331,2886,5,'Delicious !!','I ordered a 3 bottle set of both the Meritage & Moscata wines for friends who did me a huge favor and most definitely know their wines. They called me to say they thought these were both the best they had tasted in awhile !! Said they were thoroughly enjoying them and when they finished this set planned to order these 3 bottle sets on their own as they want to try all varieties !! Thanks Kevin & QVC for a hit !!'),(2887,331,2887,5,'Sumptuous delicious wine.','I ordered the White Zinfadel in the 3 bottle selection which arrived on Friday. This wine is absolutely one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. My husband and I visited Nappa Wine Valley and Sonoma Wineries about 3 years ago. Our hats off to Mr. Kevin OLeary to bring such a joy, a truly inspired new one which can certainly hold its own. We had company yesterday and everyone remarked as to how well it is done. Thank you so much for this wonderful offering.'),(2888,331,2888,5,'Excellent Moscato','This was my first purchase of these wines. Tried the Moscato as I like a sweet wine. Found it to be the best Ive ever had. The only drawback to ordering wine on line is having to be home for the delivery.
